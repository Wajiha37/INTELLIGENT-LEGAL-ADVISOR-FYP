MUHAMMAD  SAJID  MEHMOOD  SETHI,  J.-  This 
consolidated 
judgment  shall  dispose  of 
instant  petition 
alongwith following connected petition as common questions of 
law and facts are involved in these cases:-  
W.P.  No.223062  of  2018  titled  Rashda  Yaqub  v.  The 
Election Appellate Tribunal, Lahore & others 
 
2. 
Through  instant  petition,  petitioner  has  assailed  orders 
dated  19.06.2018  and  25.06.2018,  passed  by  the  Returning 
Officer,  PP-126,  Jhang-III  and  learned  Appellate  Tribunal, 
respectively,  whereby  petitioner’s  nomination  papers  for  the 
constituency in question were rejected concurrently. 
  
In  connected  petition,  petitioner  (wife  /  spouse  of 
petitioner  in  instant  petition)  has  also  challenged  orders  dated 
19.06.2018 and 25.06.2018, passed by the Returning Officer, PP-
126,  Jhang-III  and  learned  Appellate  Tribunal,  respectively, 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
2 
 
 
whereby her nomination papers for the constituency in question 
were rejected concurrently. 
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  submits  that  petitioner  did 
not hold controlling shares in M/s. Husnain Cotex Limited, thus, 
has no nexus with financial workings of said company.  He adds 
that petitioner did not own even a single share in M/s. Mianland 
Husnain  Pakistan  Limited  but  said  company  was  unjustifiably 
included  in  State  Bank  of  Pakistan’s  letter,  as  M/s.  Husnain 
Cotex  Limited  had  some  shares  in  the  aforesaid  company.  He 
further  submits  that  petitioner  does  not  have  any  concern  with 
M/s.  Ibrahim  Private  Limited  and  ownership  of  shares  in  said 
company by his son does not debar him to contest the elections. 
He  argues  that  nomination  papers  disclosed  all  requisite 
information  but  impugned  orders  have  been  passed  without 
appreciating the true facts and documentary material brought on 
record.  He  next  submits  that  petitioner  did  not  get  any  loan 
written  off,  therefore,  the  Elections  Act,  2017  &  judgment  of 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  do  not  debar  petitioner  to  contest 
elections  after  discharging  the  liability.  He  maintains  that 
liabilities  in  relation  to  M/s.  Ibrahim  Private  Limited  have 
already  been  settled  and  regarding  Saudi  Pak  Lease,  stay  order 
passed  by  learned  Banking  Court  still  holds  the  field.  He 
contends  that  no  personal  loan  was  ever  obtained  by  petitioner, 
therefore,  loan  indicated  by  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  in  its  letter 
regarding  different  companies,  by  no  stretch  of  imagination, 
could  be  termed  as  default  on  the  part  of  petitioner.  He  argues 
that  since  the  written  off  loans  /  liabilities  were  fully  satisfied, 
none of the financial institutions ever raised any demand or filed 
any suit and even the written off loans have not been questioned 
in suo motu case pending before the Hon’ble Apex Court, thus, it 
cannot  be  held  that  the  said  written  off  loans  were  not  under 
bona  fide  business  consideration  with  the  contemplation  of 
Section  8  of  the  Financial  Institutions  (Recovery  of  Finances) 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
3 
 
 
Ordinance, 2001 (“FIO, 2001”). He goes on to argue that Article 
63(1)(n) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973  (“the  Constitution”)  stipulates  that  loan  must  have  been 
obtained by the candidate himself in his own name, therefore, the 
loan  obtained  by  a  Company  incorporated  by  the  candidate 
stands excluded from the purview of the said Article. He submits 
that  Articles  62(1)(f)  and  63(n)  of  the  Constitution,  have  no 
application in petitioner’s case. He finally prays that nominations 
papers of petitioner may be ordered to be accepted, as contesting 
election  is  fundamental  right  of  petitioner.  He  has  relied  upon 
Shamroz  Khan  and  another  v.  Muhammad  Amin  and  another 
(PLD  1978  Supreme  Court  89),  Allah  Bakhsh  v.  Ilahi  Bakhsh 
and  3  others  (PLD  1975  Lahore  359),  Habib  Bank  Ltd.  v. 
Monopoly  Control  Authority  (1986  CLC  2489)  and  Messrs 
Dawood Yamaha Ltd. v. Government of Baluchistan and 3 others 
(PLD 1986 Quetta 148). 
4. 
Conversely,  learned  Legal  Advisors  of  respondent-ECP, 
duly assisted by learned counsel for contesting respondents, have 
referred  to  judgments  passed  in  previous  round  of  litigation  to 
contend  that  loans  were  not  written  off  in  accordance  with  law 
and by lifting the veil of incorporation, petitioner was held to be 
disqualified and the same was upheld up to the level of Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court.  They  further  submit  that  since  loan  was  not 
written  off  under  State  Bank  of  Pakistan’s  Circular  No.29  and 
this  Court,  in  litigation  during  elections  of  2013,  has  already 
ruled  that  it  was  not  bona  fide  transaction  and  now  petitioners 
have to show whether they have paid the loan, which they have 
miserably  failed  to  establish,  hence,  their  nomination  papers 
were rightly rejected. They have relied upon Sami Ullah Baloch 
and others v. Abdul Karim Nousherwani and others (PLD 2018 
Supreme Court 405).

Admittedly,  nomination  papers  of  petitioner  have  been 
rejected  by  the  Returning  Officer  as  well  as  learned  Election 
Tribunal through impugned orders on the ground of written off 
loans / liabilities, which are duly reflected in SBP report dated

The  question  of  written  off  loans  /  liabilities  was 
considered by learned Full Bench of this Court vide order dated 
02.05.2013 in W.P. No.9623 of 2013 arising out of rejection of 
nomination  papers  of  petitioner  by  learned  Election  Tribunal  in 
the  matter  of  nomination  papers  filed  by  him  for  contesting  the 
elections of NA-89 Jhang-I and PP-78 Jhang-II. In the said order, 
learned  Full  Bench  of  this  Court,  after  deliberating  upon  the 
various loans obtained by the business concern of the  petitioner, 
maintained  the  order  of  the  Election  Tribunal  to  the  effect  that 
the  petitioner  was  found  guilty  of  having  overdue  /  written  off 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
5 
 
 
loans  of  more  than  two  millions  rupees  in  respect  of  Faysal 
Bank,  Ltd.,  Standard  Chartered  Bank,  Trust  Investment  Bank, 
Ltd.  and  KASB  Bank,  Ltd.,  which  fact  was  concealed  by  him. 
The  said  order  of  learned  Full  Bench  of  this  Court  was 
challenged  by  the  petitioner  by  filing  Civil  Petition  No.1206-L 
of  2013  in  the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court,  which  was  dismissed  vide 
order dated 01.10.2013, which reads as follows:- 
“Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  been  asked  to 
satisfy that after the General Election, which the petitioner 
could  not  contest  because  of  outstanding  liability  against 
him. Therefore, now any  alive issue  requiring  adjudication 
by this Court exists. He stated that there is also a question 
of  the  liability  of  his  spouse,  who  is  the  partner  in  M/s 
Ibrahim  (Pvt.)  Limited  Company.  We  have  pointed  out  to 
him that at this stage we are dealing with his case and if at 
any stage issue with regard to his spouse arose, she would 
be free to avail legal remedy in accordance with law but as 
far  as  the  petitioner  is  concerned  to  his  extent  instant 
petition has become infructuous and if he contemplates to 
contest  the  election  in  future,  he  should  present  himself 
after discharging the liability, if any.” 
  
The petitioner also filed Civil Review Petition No.287 of 
2013,  which  was  dismissed  vide  order  dated  31.01.2014,  which 
reads as under:- 
“We  have  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner.  The 
order sought to be reviewed dated 1.10.2013 is clear. We 
have been informed that four election petitions have been 
filed  against  Rashida  Yaqoob  spouse  of  the  present 
petitioner. The said petitions fall within the competence and 
jurisdiction  of  the  Election  Tribunal.  Needless  to  say  that 
the same shall be decided on their own merits. We do not 
find  any  justification  for  interfering  in  the  order  dated 
1.10.2013. This review petition is, therefore, dismissed.” 
 
8. 
In  the  order  dated  01.10.2013,  the  counsel  of  petitioner 
himself did not press the Civil Petition to the extent of rejection 
of his nomination papers, which was maintained by learned Full 
Bench  of  this  Court  on  the  ground  of  outstanding  liabilities 
against  him  and,  while  dismissing  the  Civil  Petition  as  having 
become  infructuous,  it  was  observed  in  the  order  passed  by  the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court that if petitioner contemplates to contest 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
6 
 
 
the election in future, he should present himself after discharging 
liabilities.  This  order  was  also  maintained  in  the  Civil  Review 
Petition. Admittedly, written off loans / liabilities have not been 
settled  after  the  above  decisions  of  the  learned  Full  Bench  as 
well as that of Hon’ble Apex Court.  
9. 
Learned counsel for petitioner has argued that the written 
off  loans  /  liabilities  were  fully  satisfied  because  none  of  the 
financial institutions has raised any demand or filed any suit and 
even otherwise, the written off loans have not been questioned in 
suo  motu  case  pending  before  the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court,  thus,  it 
cannot  be  held  that  the  said  written  off  loans  were  not  under 
bona  fide  business  consideration  within  the  contemplation  of 
Section  8  of  the  FIO,  2001.  This  argument  does  not  carry  any 
weight.  The  learned  Full  Bench  of  this  Court,  in  order  dated 
02.05.2013,  observed  that  neither  petitioner  nor  representatives 
of  the  bank  could  disclose  any  bona  fide  business  transaction 
which  could  have  furnished  basis  for  the  aforementioned  write 
offs.  The  above  write  offs  were  admittedly  not  under  the  BPD 
Circular  29  issued  by  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  in  the  year 
2001.  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  next  argued  that  the  term 
“he has obtained loan” or “in his own name” appearing in Article 
63(1)(n)  of  the  Constitution  means  that  loan  must  have  been 
obtained  by  the  candidate  himself  in  his  own  name  and, 
therefore,  the  loan  obtained  by  a  Company  incorporated  by  the 
candidate  stands  excluded  from  the  purview  of  the  said  Article. 
Suffice  it  to  say  that  this  argument  was  also  repelled  by  the 
learned  Full  Bench  of  this  Court  in  the  afore-referred  order, 
relevant part of which is reproduced hereunder:- 
is 
the  above  article 
The  purpose  behind 
“17. 
to 
disqualify a candidate aspiring for a seat in the Parliament if 
he is a loan defaulter or has got his loan written off, the loan 
being  an  amount  of  Rs.2  million  or  more  from  any  bank, 
financial  institution,  cooperative  society  or  cooperative 
body,  in  his  own  name  or  his  spouse  or  any  of  his 
dependent.  It  will  be  restricting  the  above  constitutional 
disqualification if it were to only cover situations where the 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
7 
 
 
aspiring  the  candidate  has  obtained  loan  as  a  natural 
person  under  his  own  name  and  disregard  the  loans 
obtained  by  the  candidate  through  the  vehicle  of  his 
business  which  may  be  a  corporate  entity.  The 
disqualifications under Article 63 are penal provisions and in 
order  to  effectively  enforce  the  same  the  Court  is  free  to 
assess  whether  the  candidate  himself  or  through  his 
business or any other corporate entity has obtained the loan 
that stands in default thereof. The “veil of the incorporation” 
is  what  separates  the  petitioner  /  candidate  from  the 
business  corporate  entity  i.e.,  M/s.  Ibrahim  (Pvt.)  Limited. 
The  said  veil  can  be  lifted  to  determine  whether  the 
petitioner  is  the  major  beneficiary  of  the  loan  obtained  by 
the  corporate entity.  It  is established  principle  of  Company 
Law  that  the  Court  has  the  power  to  lift  the  veil  of 
incorporation  while  construing  the  statute  or  documents  or 
when  the  Court  is  satisfied  that  the  Company  is  a  mere 
façade  concealing  the  true  facts  or  where  it  is  established 
that the Company has an authorized agent as its controller 
or  member.  Reliance  is  placed  on  Gower’s  Principles  of 
Modern Company Law, 6th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell. 
Ibrahim 
in  M/s 
18. 
In  the  present  case  lifting  of  veil  of  incorporation 
(see  relevant  Form  “A”)  reveals  that  the  petitioner  is  a 
majority  shareholder 
(Pvt.)  Limited, 
therefore,  the  loan  obtained  by  the  said  Company  is 
considered to be the loan obtained by the petitioner for the 
purposes  of  Article  63  (1)  (n)  of  the  Constitution.  We, 
therefore,  hold  that  the  term  “he  has  obtained  loan” 
appearing  in  Article  63  (1)  (n)  of  the  Constitution  includes 
loan  obtained  by  a  candidate  or  his  business  or  by  a 
corporate entity in which the candidate holds majority share 
holding  establishing  his  control  and  management  over  the 
said business of corporate entity.” 
 
  
The case law relied upon by learned counsel for petitioner 
is  on  distinguishable  facts,  hence,  not  relevant  to  resolve  the 
controversy in hand.  
10. 
So far as the case of petitioner’s spouse, namely Rashida 
Yaqoob  is  concerned,  needless  to  mention  here  that  she 
contested  the  General  Elections,  2013.  In  previous  round  of 
litigation,  in  Election  Petition  No.119  of  2013  titled  Moulana 
Muhammad  Ahmad  Ludhyanvi  v.  Rashida  Yaqoob,  vide 
judgment dated 14.01.2016, passed by learned Election Tribunal, 
Lahore,  she  was  held  to  be  not  sagacious,  honest  and  righteous 
within  the  contemplation  of  the  provisions  of  the  afore-referred 
Article of the Constitution  as default of financial institutions and 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
8 
 
 
written off loans of her spouse were suppressed. She assailed the 
said  judgment  before  the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court  through  Civil 
Appeals  No.13-L  to  15-L  of  2016  titled  Rashida  Yaqoob  v. 
Moulana Muhammad Ahmad Ludhyanvi & others, whereby vide 
judgment  dated  07.10.2016,  she  was  disqualified  while 
upholding  the  judgment  of  learned  Election  Tribunal.  The 
relevant observations are reproduced hereunder:- 
 
17. 
The  two  orders  passed  by  this  Court  in  Civil 
Petition  and  in  Civil  Review  Petition  filed  by  the  spouse  of 
appellant do not in any manner help the case of appellant as the 
scheme  of  law  is  such  that  she  has  to  sync  or  swim  with 
attributes  of  default  in  payment  of  bank  loans  with  her  spouse. 
The  aspect  of  default  in  payment  of  loans  by  the  spouse  of 
appellant was attended to by the full bench of Lahore High Court 
in considerable detail and such determination of the full bench of 
Lahore High Court was not disturbed up to this Court either in the 
Civil  Petition  filed  by  the  spouse  of  appellant  or  in  the  Civil 
Review  Petition.  As  regard  the  fact  of  settlement  of  loans  and 
obtaining of clearance letter from the banks, we observe that the 
appellant’s spouse failed to make out any case of settlement of 
loans and obtaining of clearance letter from the banks before the 
full bench of Lahore High Court and similarly this very aspect of 
the  matter  was  not  pressed  by  the  spouse  of  appellant  in  Civil 
Petition before this Court or in the Civil Review Petition. We are 
unable  to  understand  as  to  how  this  argument  of  settlement  of 
loans  or  obtaining  of  clearance  letter  from  the  bank  could 
succeed before us when this very aspect stood adjudicated and 
determined by full bench of Lahore High Court and maintained by 
this Court, where spouse of appellant was found to be defaulter 
of bank loans. This very submission about settlement of account 
etc. is even  not supported by the letter dated  03.04.2013 of the 
State  Bank  of  Pakistan  addressed 
the  Chief  Election 
Commission of Pakistan in respect of election of appellant.” 
to 
 
  
The above judgment has also been upheld by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in CRP Nos.431-433 of 2016, with the following 
observations:- 
“Learned  ASC,  after  arguing  the  Civil  Review  Petitions,  states 
that  the  petitioner  will  be  content  if  the  review  petitions  are 
disposed of with the observation that the petitioner may contest 
the future election in accordance with law. The review petitions, 
in such terms, are disposed of.” 
 
11.  Needless to observe here  that  while deciding the  matters, 
qua 
the  acceptance  or 
rejection  of  nomination  papers, 
W.P. No.223063 of 2018 & connected case 
9 
 
 
information  provided  by  the  State  authorities  has  to  be  relied  
upon  and  the  same  cannot  be  doubted  unless  some  material  is 
placed  before  the  Court  that  the  information  so  contained  is 
either  not  up  to  date  or  is  incorrect.  The  written  off  loans  / 
liabilities, subject matter of instant case, were also considered in 
previous  round  of  litigation  and  on  that  very  basis,  petitioners 
were disqualified in terms of the judgments by Hon’ble Supreme 
Court.  Petitioners  were  required  to  show  that  loan  liabilities, 
reproduced  supra,  have  been  paid  off  after  the  afore-referred 
judgments of learned Full Bench of this Court as well as that of 
the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court  and  in  absence  whereof,  petitioner’s 
argument  that  loan  liability  stands  paid  off,  cannot  be  accepted 
for the purpose of permitting them to contest elections within the 
contemplation of afore-referred provisions of the Constitution.  
12. 
In  view  of  the  above  discussion,  instant  petition,  along 
with connected petition, is hereby  dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
