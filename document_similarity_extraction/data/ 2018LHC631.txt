Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
 
RASHEED AHMAD (DECEASED) THROUGH L.Rs. 
VERSUS 
NAZAR HUSSAIN MALIK ETC. 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
21.02.2018 
Petitioners by: 
 
Respondent No. 1: 
Sh. Usman Karim-ud-Din, Advocate. 
Sh.  Naveed  Shahryar,  Mr.  Shahid 
Mehmood  Khan  Khilji  and  Ms.  Fatima 
Malik, Advocates. 
 
 
AMIN-UD-DIN  KHAN,  J.    Despite  service,  no  one  has  shown 
appearance on behalf of respondent No. 2 and as such he is proceeded 
against ex-parte. 
 
2. 
 
Through  this  single  judgment,  I  intend  to  decide  the 
instant  Civil  Revision  as  well  as  Civil  Revision  No.  4949  of  2016.  
Through the revision petitions, the order dated 23.11.2016 passed by a 
learned Additional District Judge, Faisalabad whereby the appeal filed 
by  the  petitioners  was  dismissed  and  the  judgment/order  dated 
09.03.2016 handed down by a learned Civil Judge 1st Class, Faisalabad 
whereby objection petition filed by the petitioners was dismissed have 
been called in question. 
 
3. 
 
Brief  facts of the case  are  that on 08.03.1999, respondent 
No.  1  filed  a  suit  against  respondent  No.  2  for  recovery  of  Rs. 
 
 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
2 
 
 
 
80,00,000/- through auction of property of defendant (mentioned in the 
agreement)  on  the  basis  of  agreement  to  sell  dated  17.12.1996  before 
learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Faisalabad.  During  pendency  of  the  suit, 
petitioners  in  both  the  revision  petitions  stood  sureties  for  satisfaction 
of the decree.  On 14.10.1999, statement was recorded in the Court that 
in case of decree against  Latif Ahmad, if he  does not pay the decretal 
amount,  petitioners  will  abide  by 
the  orders  of 
the  Court.  
Subsequently, matter between the parties to the suit was settled through 
written compromise  dated 01.03.2001 exhibited as Ex.C-1.  Statement 
of the  parties to  the suit  was  recorded  on  22.03.2001  and learned  trial 
Court  decreed  the  suit  in  the  light  of  Ex.C-1  i.e.  the  compromise 
effected between the parties. Decree sheet was prepared in accordance 
with the compromise, 
 
4. 
 
It  will  not  be  out  of  place  to  mention  here  that  in  the 
original  suit,  claim  for  recovery  of  Rs.  80,00,000/-  was  made  on  the 
basis  of  agreement  dated  17.12.1996  and  it  was  sought  that  the  said 
amount  be  paid  to  the  plaintiff  after  auction  of  the  property  of 
defendant  mentioned  in  the  headnote  of  plaint  situated  in  Chak  No. 
229-RB  Tehsil  Jaranwala  District  Faisalabad  in  accordance  with 
Jamabandi  for  the  year  1994-1995  measuring  24-kanals  17-marlas  
6-sarsai  whereas    through  the  compromise,  it  was  settled  between  the 
parties  to  the  suit  that  defendant  (Latif  Ahmad)  will  get  the  property 
mentioned  in  Ex.C-1  situated  in  Chak  No.  109-RB  Tehsil  Jaranwala 
District Faisalabad transferred in the name of plaintiff (Nazar Hussain) 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
3 
 
 
 
from  the  name  of  Mst.  Parveen  Akhtar  who  is  owner  of  the  property 
and  wife  of  defendant.    It  was  further  settled  that  the  other  property 
situated  in  Chak  No.  216-W  owned  by  Mst.  Parveen  Akhtar  will  also 
be  got  transferred  in  the  name  of  plaintiff  and  further,  the  property 
situated  in  Chak  No.  216-W  mentioned  in  Ex.C-1  owned  by  Latif 
Ahmad (defendant) will also be transferred in the name of plaintiff.  As 
per compromise deed, the property owned by the defendant measuring 
32-kanals  16-marlas  Khewat  No.  1,  Khatooni  No.  1  situated  at  Tehsil 
Nankana  Sahib  District  Sheikhupura  shall  also  be  transferred  in  the 
name of plaintiff.  It was further stated in Ex.C-1 that an amount of Rs. 
2,00,000/-  will  be  paid  to  the  plaintiff  on  01.10.2001  and  four  shops 
situated  in  Chiniot  will  be  given  to  the  plaintiff.    Compromise  deed 
further contains the term that if there will be any defect or hurdle in the 
transfer  of  the  properties  mentioned  therein  in  favour  of  plaintiff, 
defendant  will  be  bound  to  pay  Rs.  5,000/-  per  marla  of  the  property 
situated  in  Chak  No.  109-RB  and  Rs.  8,000/-  per  marla  regarding  the 
property  situated  in  Chak  No.  216-RB  to  the  plaintiff.    It  was  further 
written  in  the  compromise  deed  that  a  promissory  note  of  Rs. 
6,00,000/- will also be given to the plaintiff by defendant. 
 
 
The compromise deed referred to (Ex.C-1) was also thumb 
marked by  Mst. Parveen  Akhtar  and decree  was  passed  in  accordance 
with the terms of said document. 
 
5. 
 
Lengthy  arguments  have  been  advanced  by  both  the 
learned  counsel.  I  have  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
4 
 
 
 
examined  the  record  appended  with  both  the  revisions  petitions  with 
the able assistance of learned counsel for the parties. 
 
6. 
 
It is on the record that subsequently, Mst. Parveen Akhtar 
filed an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC and challenged the 
judgment and decree passed with regard to the properties owned by her.  
On 30.10.2003, learned counsel for the decree holder made a statement 
that decree holder has no objection if name of Mst. Parveen Akhtar  is 
deleted  from  the  decree.    In  the  opinion  of  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent  No.  1  (decree  holder),  according  to  para-8  of  the 
compromise  deed  (Ex.C-1),  the  amount  is  to  be  recovered  from  the 
judgment  debtor  and  handed  over  to  the  decree  holder,  therefore,  the 
persons who stood sureties are also obliged to satisfy the decree.   
 
7. 
 
Execution  petition  was  filed  on  25.10.2001.    In  the 
previous  round  of  litigation,  when  the  property  was  attached,  the 
sureties filed an appeal before this Court in shape of F.A.O. No. 87 of 
2012  to  challenge  the  order  qua  attachment  of  property.    The  appeal 
was though dismissed but with an observation that the appellant will be 
at liberty to raise all the objections before the learned executing Court.  
Thereafter,  revision  petitioners  filed  objections  before  the  learned 
executing  Court  which  were  dismissed  and  appeal  preferred 
thereagainst  was  also  dismissed.    Hence  the  instant  Civil  Revision  as 
well as Civil Revision No. 4949 of 2016. 
 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
5 
 
 
 
8. 
 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  pressed  that  the 
suit had not been decided on merits after recording evidence regarding 
the subject matter but it was a result of compromise between the parties 
and that too decree was granted with regard to the property which was 
not subject matter of the suit.  Therefore, petitioners are not bound by 
the decree and they cannot be compelled to satisfy the decree. 
 
9. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent 
No.1 (decree holder) argues that objection under Order XXI Rule 58 of 
the  CPC  must  be  within  reasonable  time  but  the  objection  was  filed 
after  a  long  delay,  therefore,  prays  for  dismissal  of  both  the  revision 
petitions. 
 
10. 
 
When  a  decree  was  granted  on  the  basis  of  compromise 
with regard to the property which  was not subject matter of the suit, I 
am afraid that the decree cannot be executed by the Court. Admittedly, 
petitioners never consented for satisfaction of the decree regarding the 
properties which were not subject matter of the suit.  The suit was not 
decided  on  merits  and  decree  was  passed  on  the  basis  of  compromise 
with regard to the properties which were not subject matter of the suit.  
Even the decree for recovery of money was granted in accordance with 
Ex.C-1  with  the  understanding  that  in  case  of  non-transfer  of  the 
properties  mentioned  therein  in  the  name  of  decree  holder,  money 
would  be  recovered  in  accordance  with  the  ratio  settled  therein  after 
auction  of  the  subject  properties.    Therefore,  by  no  stretch  of 
imagination, it can be said that sureties are bound to satisfy the decree 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
6 
 
 
 
of the Court granted on the basis of compromise deed, especially when 
they were not privy to the contract of compromise. 
 
11. 
 
To strengthen the view taken by this Court, reliance can be 
placed  upon  “M.C.B.  BANK  LTD.  versus  DEPUTY  FREE  SHOP 
LTD.” (PLD 2011 Karachi 586).  I quote paragraphs No. 13 and 14 of 
the judgment:- 
 
“13.  The  other  point  to  be  noted  with  regard  to  the 
substituted proviso (i.e., as presently applicable) is that it 
expressly  refers  to  the  sale  of  the  attached  property,  a 
reference missing entirely in the sub-rule prior thereto. It 
appears that earlier there was a divulgence of opinion as 
to  whether  objections  under  Rule  58  could  only  be  taken 
upon  attachment  but  before  sale  or  whether,  even  if  they 
could  be  taken  after  sale,  the  application  under  Rule  58 
had to be filed prior to the confirmation of the sale.  In my 
view,  the  express  reference  to  the  sale  of  the  attached 
property  sets  this  controversy  at  rest,  and  this  is  all  the 
more  so  given  that  the  only  remedy  now  available  to  the 
objector is by way of an application under Rule 58 and not 
by  means  of  a  separate  suit.    It  therefore  follows  that  an 
objection  or  claim  as  now  envisaged  in  Rule  58  can  be 
taken  (subject  to  the  terms  thereof)  at  any  time  after 
attachment  and  may  even  be  taken  after  confirmation  of 
the subsequent sale. 
 
14.  The  next  point  to  be  noted  with  regard  to  the 
proviso  is  that  the  “first  attachment”  referred  to  therein 
(which, in my view, continues to have the same meaning as 
in  the  original  Lahore  High  Court  amendment)  must 
comply  with  the  requirements  in  relation  to  attachment.  
Of these, the most important is the well settled proposition 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
7 
 
 
 
that an attachment is not effective simply on the making of 
the  attachment  order,  but  only  when  it  has  been  given 
effect  to  in  the  prescribed  manner,  namely  as  per  the 
requirements  of  Rule  54.    Now,  it  is  well  settled  that 
substantial  compliance  of  Rule  54  is  sufficient  for  the 
attachment to become effective.  However, in my respectful 
view, when the question of whether the modalities of Rule 
54 have been complied with or not arises in the context of 
considering  an  objection  under  Rule  58,  a  substantial 
gloss  must  be  placed  on  the  case-law,  and  even  greater 
care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  there  has  been  such 
sufficient  compliance  of  Rule  54  as  meet  the  ends  of 
justice.  This is so because once it is held that attachment 
has been properly effected, then the proviso of Rule 58(1) 
may  become  engaged  in  appropriate  circumstances  and 
that  can,  for  the  reasons  given  above,  have  materially 
adverse consequences for the objector, up to and including 
completely  shutting  out his objection  or  claim altogether, 
which would effectively leave him remediless.” 
 
12. 
 
I  can  further  rely  upon  “Narsingh  Mahton  and  others  v. 
Nirpat Singh and others” (A.I.R. 1932 Patna 313).  I quote the relevant 
extract therefrom:- 
 
 
“A term in a contract of suretyship was as follows:  
If the suit is decided against the defendants and a decree 
for  mesne  profits  is  passed  in  favour  of  the  plaintiffs,  the 
plaintiffs  would  realize  the  amount  of  decree  of  mesne 
profits from the property mentioned in this deed.  The suit 
with regard to claim of possession was decided against the 
defendants  and 
the  plaintiffs  and 
the  defendants 
compromised  their  dispute  as  to  the  mesne  profits  and 
agreed  upon  a  definite  sum  exceeding  the  amount  for 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
which  surety  was  given  and  a  certain  time  was  given  to 
defendants within which to make the payment. 
 
Held:  that  both  by  the  making  of  the  compromise 
and the granting of time the surety was discharged. (P-315 
C-1)” 
13. 
 
Light can also be taken from the rule of law enunciated in 
“Muhammad  Yusaf  v.  Ram  Govinda  Ojha”  [A.I.R.  1928  Calcutta 
177(2)] wherein it was concluded as under:- 
 
 
 
14. 
 
“When a surety agrees that if the creditor is unable 
to obtain payment of the decretal amount from the debtor, 
to liquidate any sum which the Court after contest should 
hold payable by the debtor to the creditor but the suit was 
compromised and decree was obtained on the basis of the 
award of the arbitrator: 
 
Held:    that  such  an  arrangement  operated  as  a 
discharge of the surety. (P 178 C2)” 
 
Reliance  can  be  placed  upon  “National  Coal  Co.,  Ltd.  v. 
Kshitish Bose and Co.” (A.I.R. 1926 Calcutta 818) and relevant portion 
of the judgment is reproduced below:- 
 
 
“If  a  consent  decree 
is  passed  without 
the 
knowledge and consent of the surety for judgment debtor, 
the surety is discharged. (P-818 C-2)” 
 
15. 
 
The  rule  of  law  expounded  in  “Mahomedalli  Ibrahimji  v. 
Lakshmibai  Anant  Palande”  (A.R.I.  1930  Bombay  122)  can  also  be 
relied upon wherein it was held that surety for defendant is discharged 
if suit is compromised and if compromise is not contemplated by surety 
and is prejudicial to his rights. 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
9 
 
 
 
 
16. 
 
I  would  further  like  to  rely  upon  “N.D.  LEASING 
CORPORATION versus NATIONAL FIBERS LTD.” (2002 CLD 643) 
and to quote the relevant portion thereof as follows:- 
 
 
“The  principle  underlying 
the  revocation  or 
discharge  of  guarantee  are  provided  in  sections  133  to 
141  of  the  Contract  Act.    Under  section  133  a  variance, 
made  without  the  surety  consent,  discharge  a  surety  in 
respect  of  transactions  subsequent  to  the  date  of  the 
variance.    Under  section  134  the  surety  is  discharged  by 
any  contract  between  the  Creditors  and  Principal  by 
which  Principal  debtor  is  released  or  by  any  act  or 
omission by the Creditor, the legal consequence of which 
is the discharge of the Principal debtor.  These provisions 
clearly  state  that  the  surety  could  be  discharged  of  their 
liability  in  the  event  of  any  occurrence  as  mentioned 
therein.” 
 
17. 
 
The  case  law  referred  to  by  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent  No.  1  in  shape  of  “SHAHAMAD  KHAN  versus  Sh. 
MUHAMMAD AKBAR and others” (2005 CLC 641), “Messrs ASIM 
TRADERS  through  Sole  Proprietor  and  others  versus  NATIONAL 
BANK  OF  PAKISTAN 
through  Manager”  (2016  CLD  1654), 
“INDUSTRIAL  DEVELOPMENT  BANK  OF  PAKISTAN  versus 
HYDERABAD  BEVERAGE  COMPANY  PRIVATE  LIMITED  and 
others”  (2016  CLD  560)  and  “INDUSTRIAL  DEVELOPMENT 
BANK  OF  PAKISTAN  versus  HYDERABAD  BEVERAGE 
COMPANY  PRIVATE  LIMITED  and  others”  (2016  SCMR  451)  is 
Civil Revision No. 4900 of 2016 
10 
 
 
 
absolutely not applicable to the facts of the case, therefore, not helpful 
for respondent No. 1. 
 
18. 
 
I  am  of  the  further  view  that  when  terms  were  settled 
between  the  parties  to  the  suit  through  a  compromise,  surety  is 
discharged  in  the  light  of  Sections  133,  134  and  135  of  the  Contract 
Act, 1872. 
 
19. 
 
Pursuant  to  above,  the  findings  recorded  by  both  the 
learned  Courts  below  are  nullity  in  the  eye  of  law  and  as  such  not 
sustainable.    Hence,  both  the  revision  petitions  are  allowed  and 
resultantly,  the  order  dated  09.03.2016  as  well  as  judgment  dated 
23.11.2016  passed  by  learned  Civil  Judge,  Faisalabad  and  learned 
Additional District Judge, Faisalabad respectively are set aside.
