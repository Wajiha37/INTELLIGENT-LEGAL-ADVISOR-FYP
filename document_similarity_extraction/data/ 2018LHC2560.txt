The  alleged  allotment  of  Ashraf  Ali  Zaidi  was 
cancelled 
on 
31.01.1972 
by 
the  Settlement 
Commissioner. Ch. Muhammad  Ismail  (vendee  of the 
land from the allottee) challenged the said cancellation 
through  Writ  Petition  No.273-R/1972  but  he  died 
during 
the  pendency  of 
the  said  writ  petition, 
subsequently,  the  said  writ  petition  was  dismissed  in 
default  vide  order  dated  13.02.1980.  Application  for 
restoration  filed  by  his  legal  heirs  was  also  dismissed 
on  26.06.1983.  The  petition  for  leave  to  appeal  was 
also  dismissed  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan.  The  legal  heirs  of  Ch.  Muhammad  Ismail 
filed Writ Petition No.33-R/1990 which was dismissed 
as  withdrawn.  One  Mst.  Hajan  Sunnat  Bibi  (vendee) 
filed application under section 12 (2) CPC to set aside 
the  withdrawal  order  which  was  allowed  vide  order 
dated  08.11.2000.  The  said  order  was  assailed  before 
ICA No.811/2015

Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  and  the  Hon‟ble 
Apex Court remanded the case for decision afresh.  
 
The  allotment  of  Payaray  Khan  etc.  at  Khata 
No.131-136 which was cancelled on 19.10.1966 by the 
competent  authority  and  the  said  cancellation  order 
remained  intact  upto  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan.  The  land  allotted  to  Allah  Wasaya  was  also 
resumed  in  favour  of  the  state  on  18.12.1969  which 
resumption  order  was  also  upheld  upto  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
3.  Mst.  Sultana  Begum  and  others  were  allegedly 
allotted some evacuee land in Qila Deedar Singh detail 
where of is as under:-

She  was  allotted  land  measuring  1575  Kanals  16 
Marlas against her alleged evacuee claim at Khata 191 
RL-II  vide  allotment  order  dated  19.05.1968  by 
making  amendment  of  Khatta  RL-II  168  in  record  of 
Settlement  Department.  The  above  allotment  of 
Sultana  Begum  was  challenged  by  the  vendee  from 
Atta Muhammad etc. before the Settlement Authorities 
for  removal  of  the  anomaly  of  duel  allotment  of  one 
and  same  land  to  two  different  claimants.  The 
allotment  of  subsequent  allottee  Sultana  Begum  was 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
4 
cancelled  on  11.02.1975.  Feeling  aggrieved  whereof 
she  assailed  the  cancellation  order  through  filing  writ 
petitions  which  was  accepted  and  the  case  was 
remanded 
for 
fresh  decision  vide  order  dated 
27.02.1976.  One  Khuda  Bakhsh  vendee  from  Peyary 
Khan  also  filed  application  under  Section  10  &  11  of 
the  Land  Settlement  Act  1958  for  the  cancellation  of 
allotment  of  Mst.  Sultana  Begum,  which  application 
was  dismissed  by  the  Settlement  Commissioner  vide 
order  dated  20.04.1977.  Against  the  above  order  he 
filed  Writ  Petition  Nos.925/R  and  1446/R  of  1977 
which  were  accepted  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated 
03.03.1980.  Against  the  above  order  Mst.  Sultana 
Begum  filed  civil  petition  No.645  of  1980  in  the 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  which  was  converted  into 
appeal  bearing  C.A.  No.653/1984  vide  order  dated 
05.05.1984.  Simultaneously  Khuda  Bakhsh  also 
assailed 
the  order  dated  03.03.1980  by 
filing 
C.P.No.1429/1980 in which leave was also granted on 
5.5.1984 and petition was converted into Civil Appeal 
No.655/1984. Both the above appeals were disposed of 
by  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  as  the  same 
have become infructuous vide order dated 30.05.1991, 
as the matter of allotment of Atta Muhammad at Khata 
No.168 of RL II was still pending adjudication before 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
5 
the  Settlement  Authorities.  The  Additional  Settlement 
Commissioner  vide  order  dated  19.12.1985  declared 
the  allotment  of  said  Atta  Muhammad  as  illegal  and 
cancelled 
the  same,  however,  he  allowed 
the 
subsequent  vendees  from  first  allottee  to purchase the 
said  land  under  their  possession  @  Rs.100/-  PIUs.  
Against the above  orders  two  writ petitions.5-R/1986, 
W.P.No.345/R of 1984 were filed by Mst. Fatima Bibi 
and one Writ Petition No.33-R/1990 was filed by  one 
Shahid  Ismail  etc.  This  Court  vide  order  dated 
08.11.2000 declared the allotment of Atta Muhammad 
as illegal and the subsequent vendee from him have no 
legal  right  to  retain  possession  of  the  cancelled  land. 
Against  the  said  order,  two  civil  petitions  were  filed 
before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan wherein 
leave  was  granted  and 
the  said  petitions  were 
converted  into  Civil  Appeal  (i.e.  Appeal  Nos.2731  to 
2733  of  2001)  which  were  allowed  and  case  was 
remanded to this Court vide order dated 05.05.2008 for 
fresh decision. A Review petition was filed against the 
above  order  which  was  also  dismissed  as  withdrawn 
vide  order  dated  17.02.2010.  In  the  post  remand 
proceedings  of  Writ  Petition  Nos.5-R/1986,  345-
R/1984  &  33-R/1990,  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-
Chambers  vide  judgment  dated  22.05.2015  accepted 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
6 
Writ  Petition  No.5-R/1986  and  set  aside  the  order 
dated 
19.12.1985 
passed 
by 
the  Additional 
Commissioner 
(R)/S.C. 
(l)/Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner,  Gujranwala  Division,  Gujranwala  and 
validated the allotment dated 19.05.1968 of subsequent 
alleged allottee Mst. Sultana Begum. Hence, this Intra 
Court Appeal. 
4. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  submits  that 
under  Section  3  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975,  the 
Additional  Settlement  Commissioner  rightly  passed 
order  by  allowing  the  subsequent  purchaser  from  the 
original  allottee  to  purchase  the  evacuee  land  @ 
Rs.100 PIUs; that the appellants firstly purchased land 
from  Atta  Muhammad  etc.,  but  his  allotment  was 
cancelled as the same was a double allotment, later on, 
the  Additional  Settlement  Commissioner  gave 
opportunity  to  the  occupant  to  purchase  the  land  in 
their  possession  under  Section  3(1)(b)  of  the  Evacuee 
Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act 
No.XIV of 1975 and the appellants purchased the land 
in  their  respective  possession;  that  the  learned  Single 
Judge-in-Chambers  misconstrued  the  provision  of 
Section  3  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975  and  illegally  set 
aside the order for sale of the land to the appellant; that 
allotment  dated  19.05.1968  in  favour  of  Mst.  Sultana 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
7 
Begum,  Raj,  Nazar  and  Mst.  Shah  Bibi  were  also 
double allotments of the land which was not available 
for any allotment as the allotment of Atta Muhammad 
and  other  was  still  intact  as  the  same  was  not  yet 
cancelled by the competent authority at the time of its 
allotment  to  subsequent  allottee  whereas  without 
lawful resumption of the said land, the same could not 
be  re-allotted  any  further  as  such  the  subsequent 
allotment in favour Sultana Begum  etc. is liable to be 
cancelled being bogus in nature. 
5. 
Learned  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of  the 
respondents  states 
that  very  allotment  of  Atta 
Muhammad  etc.,  was  obtained  by  practicing  fraud 
which  allotment  was  void  ab  initio  and  same  was 
liable to be ignored; that the order of allotment of Mst. 
Sultana  Begum  etc.,  was  rightly  passed  by  the 
competent authority against the genuine verified claim; 
further  submits  that  the  appellants  purchased  the  land 
from the fraudulent allottees, as such the possession of 
the  appellant  over  the  land  is  that  of  an  illegal 
occupant,  and  they  are  not  entitled  to  get  relief  as 
embodied  in  Section  3  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975. 
Further asserted that land was not available to be sold 
out  to  the  appellants  as  the  same  has  already  been 
allotted  to  Mst.  Sultana  Begum  on  19.05.1968,  as 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
8 
such, learned Single Judge-in-Chambers rightly passed 
judgment and has committed no illegality.   
6.  We  have  heard  the  arguments  of  the  learned 
counsels  for  both  the  parties  at  full  length  and  gone 
through the record with their able assistance.  
7. 
Admittedly  the  impugned  land  comprising  of 
Khata  RL-II  Nos.123,  131  to  136,  158,  162,  168  as 
well  as  Khata  RL-II  Nos.  144,  191  to  193  situated  in 
Qila  Didar  Singh  District  Gujranwala  was  an  evacuee 
land. The pictorial map of Qila Didar Singh is scannd 
herein below:- 
 
 
As  per  official  record  Qila  Didar  Singh  was  a  Town 
Committee  before  partition  of  India  as  evinces  from 
the  letter  of  the  Deputy  Commissioner,  Gujranwala 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
9 
dated  25.01.1935.  Scanned  copy  of  the  said  letter  is 
reproduced as under:- 
 
Similarly the status of Town Committee of Qila Didar 
Singh  was  further  upgraded  as  Municipal  Committee 
vide  official  Gazette  Notification  dated  12.05.1961, 
scanned copy whereof is as under:- 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
10 
 
 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
11 
From  perusal  of  above 
letter  of 
the  Deputy 
Commissioner  as  well  as  the  Notification  dated 
12.05.1961  it  can  conveniently  be  said  that  the  land 
comprising of the above said Khatta RL-II Numbers do 
fall  within 
the 
limits  of  Town  and  Municipal 
Committee, Qila Didar Singh.  
Before dealing with the respective assertions and 
contentions  of  the  parties  as  well  as  the  legal  and 
factual  issues  involved  in  the  lis,  it  is  appropriate  to 
shed light on the plain provisions of law as well as the 
case 
law  on 
the  subject.  For  Settlement  and 
Rehabilitation  of  the  Evacuees,  the  Govt.  of  Pakistan 
issued many policies, guidelines and finally legislature 
enacted  the  Displaced  Persons  (Land  Settlement)  Act, 
1958  to  streamline,  legalize  the  efforts  and  process of 
the  Rehabilitation  of  the  Evacuee  claimants.  Before 
and after the above enactment majority of the evacuees 
were settled during the process of rehabilitation. Under 
the  guise  of  being  evacuees  certain 
ingenuine 
claimants  fraudulently  got  allotted  evacuee  land.  To 
eradicate  such  grotesque  practice  of 
fraudulent 
allotments Sections 10 and 11 of the Act ibid furnishes 
procedure  to  cater  the  situation.  There  was  another 
aspect  of  the  allotments  of  the  evacuee  lands  that  the 
claims  of  rural/agricultural  PIUs  were  being  adjusted 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
12 
against the urban properties  beyond the entitlement of 
claimants and in order to curb  such practice the Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner  finally  issued  Notification 
on  16.05.1973  declaring  all  the  evacuee  agricultural 
land situated in urban limits of Municipal Corporation 
Notified  Area  Committee,  Municipal  Committee  and 
Tehsil Committee etc., in the entire province of Punjab 
to  be  building  site  and  since  the  issuance  of  said 
notification  all  such  agricultural  land  situated  within 
urban  limits  was  excluded  from  any  allotment  against 
the  agricultural  rural  unit.  The  said  notification  is 
reproduced as under:- 
“In exercise of powers conferred upon me under clause 
(b)  of  sub-section  (3)  of  section  2  of  the  Displaced 
Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958, IO, Mr. M. Aslam 
Awais,  C.S.P.,  Chief  Settlement  and  Rehabilitation 
Commissioner,  Punjab  do  hereby  declare  all 
the 
available  evacuee  urban  land,  including  the  one  not  yet 
confirmed  to  any  person  against  units  or  evacuee  land 
which  may  become  available  in  future,  in  all  the 
Revenue  Estates  situated  within  the  Urban  limits  of  a 
Municipal  Corporation,  Municipal  Committee,  Notified 
Area  Committee,  Town  Area  Committee,  Small  Town 
Committee  and  Sanitary  Committee,  or  a  Cantonment, 
throughout the Province of Punjab, as building sites, for 
disposal under section 13 of the said Act.” 
Ultimately  the  evacuee  laws  on  the  subject  were  also 
repealed  through  Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced 
Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act  No.XIV  of  1975  giving 
retrospective  effect  from  1st  of  July,  1974,  whereafter 
the further allotment of the evacuee land was restricted 
with  the  exception  that  only  the  actively  pending 
proceedings 
before 
the 
Chief 
Settlement 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
13 
Commissioner or the matter remanded by the Supreme 
Court  or  the  High  Court  were  to  be  decided  by  the 
Notified  Officer  as  prescribed  in  Section  2  of  the 
Repealing  Act,  1975.  Whereas  Section  3  of  the 
Repealed  Act,  1975  prescribed  the  criteria  for  the 
Management and Disposal of urban Evacuee Land. For 
ready reference, Section 3 is reproduced as under:- 
“3. 
Transfer  of  property.  (1)  All  properties,  both 
urban  and  rural,  including  agricultural  land,  other  than 
such  properties  attached  to  charitable,  religious  or 
educational  trusts  or  institutions,  whether  occupied  or 
unoccupied,  which  may  be  available  for  disposal 
immediately before the repeal of the aforesaid Acts and 
Regulations,  or  which  may  become  available  for 
disposal  after  such  repeal  as  a  result  of  a  final  order 
passed  under  sub-section  (3)  of  section  2,  shall  stand 
transferred to the Provincial Government, on payment of 
such  price  as  may  be  fixed  by  the  Federal  Government 
in  consultation  with  the  Provincial  Government,  for 
disposal:- 
(a) 
in the case of urban properties, by the Provincial 
Government under a scheme to be prepared by it in this 
behalf; and 
(b) 
in  the  case  of  rural  properties,  by  the  Board  of 
Revenue of the Province under a scheme to be prepared 
by the Provincial Government in this behalf: 
 
Provided  that  agricultural  land  occupied  by  any 
person  continuously  for  four  harvests  immediately 
preceding  Kharif  1973  shall  first  be  offered  for  sale  to 
such  person  unless  an  order  of  ejectment  has  been 
passed against him in respect of such land: 
 
Provided further that only so much land shall be 
offered  to  such  person  as  does  not  together  with  land 
already held by him, exceed a subsistence holding within 
the meaning of the Land Reforms Regulation, 1972.” 
Under  the  above  provision  of  law  all  the  evacuee 
properties/land  against  the  paid  consideration  were 
transferred  to  the  Provincial  Government  which  was 
mandated  to  visualize  the  policies  for  disposal  of  the 
urban  evacuee  land.  The  Provincial  Government 
Under  Section  3(1)(a)    of  the  Act  ibid  prepared  a 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
14 
scheme  for  the  transfer  of  the  urban  land  named  as 
“Scheme  For 
the  Management  and  Disposal  of 
Available  Urban  Properties”  promulgated  on  13th  of 
January  1977.  An  elaborate  procedure  is  provided  in 
paras  1,  6,  11,12  and  30  of  the  above  policy  for  the 
disposal  of  urban  land.  The  vires  of  the  above  policy 
came  under  judicial  scrutiny  and  Hon‟ble  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  reported  as  American 
International  School  System  Vs.  Mian  Muhammad 
Ramzan  &  Others  (2015  SCMR  1449)  conclusively 
held that all the urban properties are to be disposed of 
through unrestricted public auction. Relevant paras are 
reproduced as under:- 
“In the instant cases, as record shows that on mere desire 
of  the  ten  Chief  Minister  of  Punjab,  the  Member 
(Colonies)  BOR,  Punjab  doled  out  valuable  “residual 
evacuee  property”  at  a  throw  away  price  to  the 
petitioner-School,  knowing  fully  well  that  the  subject 
property  is  not  the  State  land  and  that  the  subject 
evacuee  land  could  only  be  disposed  off  through  open 
auction in terms of the Scheme, 1977 and otherwise, he 
was  not  at  all  competent  to  undertake  such  exercise, 
which  authority  under  the  Scheme,  1977  vested  in  the 
Member, Board of Revenue (Residual Properties).”  
Further  there  is  no  provision  in  the  Evacuee  Repeal 
Laws that the Evacuee land can be disposed of through 
any  private  treaty  and  a  glorified  modus  oprandi  for 
disposal  of  the  evacuee  land  through  unrestricted 
public auction has finally been selected as suitable for 
the best interest of the state as discussed in the case of 
Muhammad  Din  &  Others  Vs.  Ghulam  Muhammad 
 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
15 
Naseem Sindhu & Others (PLD 1991 SC 1) as well as 
in  C.P.  No.709-L/2009  titled  Member  (Judicial-V), 
Board  of  Revenue/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner, 
Punjab  &  2  Others  Vs.  Sagheer  Muhammad  Khan  & 
Others, where the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
vide  order  dated  02.01.2015  has  settled  that  after  the 
Repeal Act 1975, the urban evacuee property can only 
be  disposed  of  through  open  auction,  relevant  portion 
thereof is reproduced as under:-  
“7.  Considering  the  above,  we  are  clear  firstly  that  the 
conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Bench in para 9 of 
the impugned judgment, as reproduced above is incorrect and 
the  reliance  on  the  case  of  Muhammad  Hussain  (supra)  is 
also  misplaced.  Secondly,  it  is  evident  that  as  of  date,  the 
respondents  can  have  no  claim  on  the  property  in  question. 
According  to  the  current  law  and  arrangements  put  in  place 
by  the  Province  subsequent  to  the  Repeal  Act  the  property 
will  have  to  be  disposed  of  through  open  public  auction  so 
that  the  assets  vested  in  the  Province  and  ultimately  in  the 
people  of  the  Province  are  duly  protected.  This  shall  not 
prevent the Province from proceeding against the respondents 
or  others  both  for  recovery  of  compensation  for  occupation 
and  use  of  the  property  and  for  any  other  action  civil  or 
criminal  in  this  case.  This  petition  is  converted  into  appeal 
and is allowed in the above terms.” 
Moreover  after 
issuance  of  notification  dated 
16.05.1973 by the Chief Settlement and Rehabilitation 
Commissioner,  Punjab,  no  allotment  can  be  made  on 
the  basis  of  any  claim  or  unadjusted  unit  of  the 
evacuee  claimant.  The  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan  in  a  reported  case    Ali  Muhammad  through 
LRs  &  Others  Vs.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  & 
Other  (2001  SCMR  1822)  has  discussed  in  detail  the 
vires  of  notification  dated  16.05.1973  and  declared 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
16 
that  after  issuance  of  the  above  notification  no  urban 
evacuee  land  can  be  allotted  on  the  basis  of  any 
evacuee  claim  or  unsatisfied  or  unadjusted  PIUs.  As 
per  the  above  notification,  the  evacuee  agricultural 
land  (urban)  was  declared  building  site  and  same  has 
gone  out  of  the  rural  agricultural  compensation  pool, 
whereafter  the  said  evacuee  land  neither  can  be 
allotted  against  any  claim  nor  sold  to  any  sitting 
occupants  through  any  private  treaty.  Reliance  is 
placed on the cases of Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali etc. Vs. 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  &  Others  (PLD  1973 
SC 236), The Chief Settlement Commissioner, Lahore 
Vs.  Raja  Muhammad  Fazil  Khan  and  others  (PLD 
1975 SC 331), Muhammad Younus Khan & 12 Others 
Vs. Government of N.W.F.P. through Secretary, Forest 
and  Agriculture,  Peshawar  &  Others  (1993  SCMR 
618),  Lal  Din  &  Another  Vs.  Muhammad  Ibrahim 
(1993  SCMR  710),  Khair  Din  Vs.  Mst.  Salaman  & 
Others  (PLD  2002  SC  677),  Talib  Hussain  &  Others

Others  (PLD  2009  SC  419)  &  Lahore  Development 
Authority Vs. Firdous Steel Mills (Pvt.) Limited (2010 
SCMR 1097). Further, it is made obligatory upon the 
state  functionaries  that  any  disposal  of  evacuee  urban 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
17 
land as well as its letting or leasing out shall be made 
through  transparent,  unrestricted  public  auction  to 
safeguard the sacred interest of the public as laid down 
in  a 
recent 
judgment 
reported  as  American 
International  School  System  Vs.  Mian  Muhammad 
Ramzan  &  Others  (2015  SCMR  1449),  wherein  the 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  has  held  that 
under  Paragraphs  1  (d),  11,  12  and  30  of  the  Scheme 
for  Management  and  Disposal  of  Available  Urban 
Properties, 1977, the evacuee urban properties shall be 
disposed  of  (if  needed)  through  unrestricted  public 
auction.  As  discussed  above  it  has  abundantly  been 
clear  and  conclusively  settled  that  urban  agricultural 
evacuee  land  could  only  be  disposed  of  through 
unrestricted public auction and any slightest deviation 
from the law rendered such act as illegal and  void as it 
is well settled law that when law requires a thing to be 
done in a particular manner, the same should be done 
in that very particular manner, otherwise not. Reliance 
is  placed  on  “Government  of  the  Punjab,  Food 
Department  through  Secretary  Food  &  Another  Vs. 
Messrs United Sugar Mills Limited & Another” (2008 
SCMR 1148). 
8. 
Now  attending 
to 
the  question  of  double 
allotment  of  evacuee  land  against  one  claim  of  Atta 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
18 
Muhammad,  it  is  pertinent  to  have  glance  at  the 
entitlement of the claimant.  The chequered episode of 
this  case  is  that  one  Atta  Muhammad  was  displaced 
evacuee from Ferozpur India who was holding verified 
claim  of  2931  PIUs.  He  was  allotted  land  measuring 
238 Kanals 7 Marlas equal to 2018 PIUs in Khata RL-
II  No.8  in  village  Dilbagh  Rai  District  Okara  and  the 
land  measuring  185  Kanals  equal  to  1123  PIUs  was 
confirmed  in  the  name  of  his  son  Lal  Khan  in  Chak 
No.17/SP    Tehsil  Pakpattan  District  Sahiwal  and  in 
this  way  the  entire  claim  of  said  claimant  Atta 
Muhammad  stood  satisfied  in  the  year  1953  whereas 
as  per 
record  said  Atta  Muhammad  died  on 
09.06.1957.  One  Javed  Akhtar  got  prepared  a  general 
power of attorney in his favour on behalf of said Atta 
Muhammad  and  obtained  allotment  of  evacuee  land 
measuring 342-Kanals 15-Marlas at Khata No.168 RL-
II  situated  in  village  Qila  Deedar  Singh,  Tehsil  & 
District  Gujranwala  on  06.06.1966.  The  said  alleged 
attorney  further  alienated  the  allotted  land  measuring 
315-Kanals to one Lt. Col. Akbar Khan and remaining 
land  was  sold 
to  Dilshad  Ahmad  whereas 
the 
appellants  being  vendees  from  the  first  allottee  are  in 
actual physical possession of the said land. An inquiry 
was  conducted  in  the  year  1969/70  in  order  to 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
19 
ascertain 
the  genuineness  of  allotment  of  Atta 
Muhammad  and  as  a  result  of  said  inquiry  his 
allotment  was  declared 
illegal  being  a  double 
allotment  as  the  allottee‟s  entire  claim  had  already 
been stood satisfied in the year 1953 and nothing was 
pending  outstanding  qua  his  claim  whereas  claimant 
died  on  06.09.1957  before  the  passing  of  impugned 
allotment  order  dated  06.06.1966  and  finally  his 
allotment  was  cancelled  vide  order  dated  19.12.1985 
by  the  Additional  Commissioner  (R)/S.C.  (l)/Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner,  Gujranwala  Division, 
Gujranwala.  For  ready  reference,  relevant  portion 
whereof is reproduced as under:- 
“Abdul  Rashid  etc.  vendees  have  requested  that  as 
they had spent a huge amount on the improvement of 
the  disputed  land,  therefore,  they  were  ready  to 
purchase  the  same  after  depositing  the  expenses  of 
the  same  in  the  Government  Treasury,  as  they  were 
entitled to the same. The excess allotment of land at 
Khata  No.168/R.LII  of  Village  Qila  Deedar  Singh, 
(Urban),  Tehsil  &  District  Gujranwala  and  the  land 
of the said  Khata  which  had been double allotted at 
Khata  Nos.144/1,  191,  192  &  193 
is  hereby 
cancelled.  Jamdar  Amir  Muhammad  Khan  has 
disappeared  after  appearing  in  the  court  and  he  has 
not given any proof of his pending units whereas the 
vendees at Khata No.168 of R.LII are again prepared 
to  purchase  to  disputed  land  from  the  Central 
Government  which  is  already  in  their  possession. 
Therefore, they are  allowed to  purchase the same at 
the  rate  of  Rs.100  per  P.I.U  in  view  of  their 
entitlement  and  possession.  They  should  deposit  the 
sale  price  within  thirty  days  of  this  order  after 
excluding  the  period  spent  in  obtaining  the  copy  of 
this  order  in  the  Government  Treasury  and  the  land 
which is left out of the sold land at Khata No.168 of 
R-L-II  that  should  be  put  to  auction  under  the  law. 
First of all the claimant was allotted land measuring 
238-K and 7-M on 29.06.1952 at Khata No.8 of RL-
II of Village Dilbagh Rai, Tehsil & District Okara in 
lieu  of  2018  units  after  that  land  measuring  185-K 
ICA No.811/2015

If 
was  confirmed  in  his  name  at  Chak  No.17/S-P, 
Tehsil  Pakpattan  in  lieu  of  1123  units  on  7.3.1953 
making a total units of Rs.3141 which shows that he 
got  210 units in  excess  of his  entitlement. The  A.C. 
Pakpattan should cancel these 210 Units which were 
the 
later  on  allotted  at  Chak  No.17/S-P. 
allottes/possesses  of  Chak  No.17/S-P  want 
to 
purchase the land of these units, the same should be 
sold  to  them  at  the  rate  of  Rs.100  Per  PIU,  if 
otherwise the same should be disposed of by auction 
under  the  rule.  As  regards  land  relating  to  Qila 
Deedar  Singh, 
the  A.C  Saddar  Sub-Division, 
Gujranwala  should  give  ownership  rights  to  Khan 
Abdul 
bonafide 
purchasers/possesses  of  Khata    No.168  of  RL-II  of 
Qila  Deedar  Singh  at  the  rate  of  Rs.100  PIU  after 
verification  of  units  of  every  purchaser/possesses, 
keeping  in  view  kind  of  land  as  entered  in  Khata 
No.168  of  RL-II/revenue  record  for  the  year  1946-
47. 
Rashid 
Khan 
etc. 
9. 
Admittedly the above said order has never been 
challenged  by  allottee  or  the  appellants  vendees  any 
further  as  such  same  has  attained  finality  to  their 
extent.  Further  the  appellants  during  pendency  of 
above  proceedings  before  the  Settlement  authorities 
filed fresh application for the purchase of the evacuee 
land  in  their  respective  possession  under  Section 
3(1)(b)  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975,  and  the  Additional 
Commissioner 
(R)/ 
S.C.(1)/Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner,  through  above  quoted  order  dated 
19.12.1985,  allowed  the  appellants  to  purchase  the 
land  in  their  respective  possession  @  100  per  PIU 
considering  the  said  evacuee  land  as  merely  simple 
agricultural land , whereas, all such agricultural urban 
evacuee land are situated within the Municipal  Limits 
of  Qila  Didar  Singh  since  May,  1961.  Further  the 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
21 
appellant in para 2 as well as Note given in para 14 of 
the  instant  appeal  have  unambiguously  and  explicitly 
jotted  down  that  the  land  under  their  possession  is  an 
evacuee urban land having attained the status of a fully 
developed  urban  area  consisting  of  buildings, 
residences  etc.  as  well  as  commercial  buildings,  ,  as 
such  land  offered  for  sale  @  Rs.100  PIU  treating  it 
merely as an agricultural land is an illegal approach of 
the  Notified  Officer.  Whereas  all 
the  evacuee 
agricultural land falling within the limits of Municipal 
Committee  has  already  been  declared  a  building  site 
vide  Notification  dated  16.05.1973  issued  under  the 
provision of Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 
1958, which notification has also been validated by the 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  but  perhaps 
the  said 
notification  has  escaped  for  the  consideration  of  the 
Notified  Officer  who  illegally  allowed  the  sale  of 
resumed  land    through  private  understanding  against 
rural  PIUs 
in  blatant  contravention  of  above 
notification and the plain provision of Section 3 of the 
Evacuee  Trust  Properties  &  Displaced  Persons  Laws 
(Repeal)  Act,  1975  as  well  as  the  policy  of  1977 
formulated  for  the  disposal  of  the  urban  evacuee 
agricultural land. 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
22 
10.  The  appellants  also  claimed  to  be  bonafide 
purchaser  as  they  purchased  the  land  from  alleged 
allottee  namely  Atta  Muhammad  through  his  general 
power of attorney and have protection of Section 41 of 
the  Transfer  of  Property  Act,  suffice  it  to  say  that  as 
per available record said Atta Muhammad allottee died 
in  the  year  1957,  whereas    one  Javed  Akhtar  got 
prepared  a  fake  General  Power  of  Attorney  after  his 
death and obtained allotment of the urban evacuee land 
in  question  against  rural  PIUs  whereafter  he  sold  out 
the  same  to  the  appellants.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the 
alleged allotment in the name of Atta Muhammad etc., 
was  obtained  through  committing  fraud  and  mis-
representation  by  a  fake  General  Power  of  Attorney, 
whereas  the  entire  claim  of  said  Atta  Muhammad 
stood  satisfied  in  District  Okara  and  Sahiwal  as  back 
as  in  1953,  as  such  the  allotment  in  favour  of  Atta 
Muhammad  was  result  of  blatant  fraud  and  was  void 
ab initio, which does not confer any right or title upon 
the  fraudulent  allottee  or  any  subsequent  purchaser 
from  the  said  allottee.  The  subsequent  vendee  has  to 
sail  and  sink  with  title  of  their  vendor  and  they  are 
debarred  to  claim  any  better  title  than  that  of  their 
vendors.  Moreover  the  appellants‟  stance  of  bonafide 
purchaser  was  initially  turned  down  by  the  Chief 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
23 
Settlement  Commissioner 
in  his  order  dated 
11.12.1985  which  has  never  been  challenged  by  the 
appellant  and  said  order  attained  finality.  Further 
appellant  themselves  moved  application  for  purchase 
of  the  said  land  under  Section  3  of  the  Repeal  Act, 
1975  as  well  as  the  Policy  1977  on  the  subject, 
meaning 
thereby 
they 
themselves  abandoned  or 
waived  the  claim  of  bonafide  purchasers  whereafter 
they  are  precluded  to  re-assert  the  pleas  of  bonafide 
purchaser  as  such  the  protection  of  Section  41  of  the 
Transfer of Property Act is not available to subsequent 
purchaser.    Moreover  the  appellant  admitted  in  the 
para 2 as well as Note to Para 14 of the instant appeal 
that  the  impugned  land  fall  within  the  urban  limit  of 
Municipal Committee which is a building site as such 
the  same  could  not  be  offered  for  sale  through  any 
private  treaty  in  the  year  1985,  as  per  law  on  the 
subject  which  law  requires  that  all  the  urban  property 
could  only  be  disposed  of  through  unrestricted  open 
auction but contrary to the above, the Notified Officer 
committed glaring illegality by allowing the appellants 
to purchase the said land @ Rs.100 PIUs, as such the 
learned Single Judge in Chamber has rightly set aside 
the  order  of  the  Notified  Officer  dated  11.12.1985  to 
the  extent  of  sale  of  the  evacuee  land  to  appellant 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
24 
through  any  private  understandings.  As  such  the 
impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge to this 
extent  is  maintained  and  captioned  appeal  shall  be 
considered as dismissed.  
11.  Now  coming  to  the  case  of  allotment  of  Mst. 
Sultana  Begum  etc.  who  got  allotted  land  against  her 
claim  on  19.05.1968  at  Khata  RL-II  No.191  which 
Khata was carved out after introducing modification in 
Khata  RL-II  No.168,  already  allotted  to  one  Atta 
Muhammad  on  06.06.1966  prior  to  allotment  of 
subsequent  allottee.  The  allotment  of  first  allottee 
(Atta  Muhammad)  remained  intact  in  his  name  uptill 
11.12.1985, as such the said land was not available for 
any further allotment till 1985 and it is settled law that 
ancient  allotment  prevail  over 
the 
subsequent 
allotment  until  the  first  one  is  nullified  by  the 
competent  authority.  Moreover  the  Notified  Officer 
Mr.  Abdul  Rauf  Khan  Niazi,  the  then  Additional 
Deputy 
Settlement 
Commissioner/D.S.C 
(L) 
Gujranwala, to whom the passing of allotment order of 
Sultana  Begum  etc.,  was  attributed  has  made  an 
unequivocal  clear  statement  on  23.01.1975  that  his 
signatures appearing at Khata No.191, 192 and 193 of 
RL-II are fake and forged one as he had never created 
or  signed  the  above  Khata  in  settlement  record,  as 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
25 
such, 
entry 
of 
said 
Khata 
regarding 
allotment/confirmation  of  land  in  favour  of  Mst. 
Sultana  Begum  etc.,  has  no  legal  force.  The  above 
deposition  of  the  Notified  Officer  has  never  been 
controverted 
in 
the 
same  or 
the 
subsequent 
proceedings  by  the  subsequent  allottees  through  any 
documentary  evidence  which  vitiates  the  veracity  of 
their allotment.  
12.  So  far  as  the  question  of  double  allotment  is 
concerned  admittedly,  the  evacuee  agricultural  urban 
land  was  got  allotted  by  Atta  Muhammad  etc.  on 
6.6.1966 which order was incorporated in the revenue 
record and the said land was further sold out to many 
persons  who  were/are  in  possession  thereof,  as  such 
the  said  land  was  not  available  in  the  settlement  pool 
since  its  allotment  till  resumption  on  11.12.1985  and 
notified  officer  in  balatant  perversity  of  the  record  of 
settlement department, illegally allotted the urban land 
to  Sultana  Begum  etc.,  on  19.05.1968  much  prior  to 
lawful  resumption  of  the  said  land.  Though  the 
allotment of Atta Muhammad was subsequently found 
patently illegal fraudulent yet same remained intact in 
the official record rill 1985 and land was not available 
in the pool as the possession of the said land was with 
subsequent vendees of the first allottee as such the said 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
26 
land was not available for any further allotment till its 
lawful resumption and its reversion to the pool, as such 
subsequent  order  of  allotment  in  favour  of  Sultana 
Begum  etc.,  was  entirely  farcical,  fanciful,  colourable 
and  not  sustainable  in  the  eyes  of  law.  Reliance  can 
also be placed on the cases reported as Abdul Ghani Vs 
Noor  Muhammad  &  Others  (1984  SCMR  1192)  and 
Mst. Irshad Begum & 2 Others Vs Muhammad Arshad 
& 62 Others (PLD 2005 SC 347). For ready reference, 
relevant portion whereof is reproduced as under:- 
 
“14.  As  the  allotment  made  in  favour  of  Yousuf 
Ali  Khan  had  admittedly  not  been  cancelled  the 
subsequent  allotment  made  in  favour  of  the 
predecessor-in-interest  of  the  respondents  of  the 
same land was void and had rightly been ignored. 
This  is  in  line  with  the  law  laid  down  in  by  this 
Court  Abdul  Ghani  v.  Noor  Muhammad  and 
others  (1984  SCMR  1192)  wherein  at  page  1195 
this Court observed as under:- 
 
 
“The question after the remand of the case before 
the  learned  Additional  Settlement  Commissioner, 
Sahiwal,  who  then  heard  the  case,  therefore,  was 
to  confirm  or set  aside the first  order transferring 
the plot as a „building site‟ to the appellant or the 
subsequent  order  of  transfer  of  the  same  Khasra 
number  as  agricultural  land  in  favour  of  the 
respondents.  The  nature  of  the  property  viz. 
disputed  plot,  was  examined  by  the  learned 
Additional  Settlement  Commissioner  who  after 
examining  the  record  as  per  his  order,  dated 
26.4.1973 
- 
 
 
“The  disputed  land  was  a  building  site  and  was 
accordingly  allotted 
(now 
appellant)  by, 
the  Settlement  Commissioner, 
under  Displaced  Persons  (Compensation  and 
Rehabilitation)„  Act, 
these 
circumstances its allotment under Land Settlement 
Act cannot be maintained.” 
 
 
1958.  Under 
the  petitioner 
as under: 
held 
to 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
27 
“By the above finding the P.T.D issued in favour 
of  the  appellant  was  maintained.  In  this  view  of 
the  matter,  it  is  unnecessary  to  examine  the 
question  whether  on  the  issuance  of  a  P.T.D.  to 
the  appellant  the  land  was  not  available  to  be 
allotted  as  agricultural  land  to  the  respondents  as 
in  fact  the  said  P.T.D.  was  not  cancelled  at  any 
stage  and  the  case  was  taken  up  only  for  the 
purpose of resolving the dispute arising out of two 
conflicting allotments operating side by side in the 
field.” 
 
Whereas 
the 
learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers 
through  the  impugned  judgment  has  validated  the 
allotment  order  dated  19.05.1968  in  favour  of  Mst. 
Sultana  Begum  etc.  despite  the  fact  that  admittedly 
said  evacuee  land  had  already  been  allotted  to  first 
allottee  which  was  still  intact  in  the  name  of  Atta 
Muhammad  (first  allottee)  as  the  same  was  not 
cancelled  or  resumed  by  any  competent  authority 
before making of its subsequent allotment order dated 
19.05.1968 in favour of the Sultana Begum, as the said 
land  was  not  available  in  pool  of  evacuee  land  till 
19.12.1985  which  factum  alone  nullifies  the  very 
allotment in favour of subsequent allottee, Mst.Sultana 
Begum  and  the  same  is  not  sustainable  in  the  eyes  of 
law.  
Moreover  admittedly  disputed  land  fell  within 
the urban limit of Municipal Committee of Qila Didar 
Singh vide notification dated 12.05.1961 and under the 
Notification  dated  16.05.1973  as  well  as  Section  3  of 
Repeal  Act,  1975  and  Paras  1(d),11,12  and  30  of 
ICA No.811/2015 
 
28 
Policy  Scheme  1977,  the  said  land  could  not  be 
allotted  against  any  agricultural  claim.  As  such  the 
above  significant  aspect  has  escaped  from 
the 
consideration of the learned Single Judge in Chambers, 
who  erroneously  maintained  the  allotment  of  Sultana 
Begum etc. which findings are not in consonance with 
law  on  the  subject  as  such  the  same  are  hereby  set 
aside  with the  result  that  order of  allotments  at  Khata 
No.191  RL-II,  192-RL-II  and  144  RL-II  dated 
19.05.1968 is hereby declared as illegal and same also 
are also hereby set aside accordingly.  
13.  Upshot  of  the  above  discussion  is  that  the 
instant  appeal  is  dismissed.  The  land  allotted  to  Atta 
Muhammad  etc.,  which  is  presently  in  possession  of 
the  appellants/subsequent  purchasers  as  well  as  the 
land  allotted  to  Sultana  Begum  etc.,  at  Khata  RL-II 
Nos.123, 131 to 136, 158, 162 & 168 and Khata RL-II 
Nos.144, 191,192 & 193 as mentioned in tables given 
in  Para  Nos.2  &  3  of  this  judgment  be  resumed  in 
favour  of  the  state.  The  Notified  Officer/Member

the  possession  of  the  said  land  in  favour  of  the  State
