This order shall dispose of the instant 
petition  as  well  as  Writ  Petition.  No.  209510 
of  2018  titled  “Omega  Residentia  (Pvt.)  Ltd 
versus  NAB  etc”,  as  well  as  Writ  Petition  No. 
204017 of 2018 titled “Waleed  Iftikhar versus 
NAB  etc”,  as  common  questions  of  law  and 
facts are involved in all these petitions. 
2.  
Through  these  constitutional  petitions 
petitioners  have  challenged  notice  dated 
19.03.2018  issued  by  respondent  No.1/NAB 
Lahore  to  Chief  Metropolitan  Planner  (CMP), 
LDA/respondent  No.7  with  a  copy  to  “all 
concerned”  under  the  heading  of  “Devising 
Preventive Measures to Prevent Corruption 
and  Corrupt  Practices”,  under  which  a 
committee 
namely, 
“Awareness 
and 
Prevention  Regime 
for  monitoring  of 
actions 
being 
taken 
by 
Lahore 
Development  Authority  (LDA)  against  33 
illegal  housing 
societies  of  District 
Sheikhupura”,  was  constituted  by 
the 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   2 
 
Director  General,  NAB/respondent  No.1, 
through  which  following  informations  were 
required by LDA from the petitioners:-  
1.  
2.  
3.  
4. 
 
3.  
Detail of total land ownership. 
Details of plot sold. 
Accounts statements   
 Affidavit  stating  that  no  further  sale/ 
purchase,  development,  or  advertisement 
will  be  carried  out  till  final  approval  by 
the LDA. 
Brief  facts  giving  rise  to  the  filing  of 
these  petitions  are  that  petitioners  being 
developers  of  private  housing  schemes 
purchased  or  inherited  agricultural  land  and 
got prepared a formal location plan of the site 
and  submitted  it  for  approval  before  the 
competent  authority.  Vide 
letter  dated 
26.11.2013,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  LDA  was 
extended  to  Lahore  Division  in  respect  of  the 
private  housing  schemes  including  District 
Sheikhupura.  Meanwhile,  Writ  Petition  No. 
7955  of  2015  titled  “Mrs.  Imrana  Tiwana  etc 
versus  Province  of  Punjab  etc”  was  decided 
and reported as PLD 2015 Lahore 522 which 
has  been  approved  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court in 2015 SCMR 1739 holding that LDA 
had no authority to usurp the functions of the 
local 
bodies 
as 
contained 
in 
Local 
Government  Act,  2013.  Meanwhile,  notice 
dated  27.09.2017  was  issued  by  the  LDA 
under  Section 
40(2) 
of 
the 
Lahore 
Development  Authority  Act,  1975  requiring 
the  petitioners  to  demolish  the  temporary 
structure  i.e.  entry  gate,  demarcation  wall 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   3 
 
and

from 
further  proceeding/ 
processing,

private  housing 
scheme,  was  impugned  in  Writ  Petition  No. 
89134  of  2014  which  is  pending  before  the 
learned  Single  Judge  of  this  Court.  As  the 
processing  of  scheme  was  being  delayed  by 
Zila  Council,  Sheikhupura,  Writ  Petition  No. 
97733  of  2017  was  filed  before  this  Court 
which 
is  also  pending.  Thereafter, 
the 
impugned  notice  was  issued,  hence  this  writ 
petition. 
4.  
Learned  counsels  for  the  petitioners 
submit that Ajwa Garden, Omega Residentia 
and  Shadmaan  Town,  are  still  at  pre-natal 
stage and their case is pending before the Zila 
Council,  Sheikhupura 
for  grant  of 
the 
approval  and  that  the  competency  of  Zila 
Council  has  already  been  decided  by  this 
Court  as  well  as  the  apex  Court  in  Mrs. 
Imrana  Tiwana’s  case.  Adds  that  under 
Section 33-C of NAO, 1999 respondents/NAB 
have  no  jurisdiction  to  issue  such  notice  to 
LDA  who  illegally  required  the  above  said 
information  from  the  petitioner.  Adds  that 
there  is  no  bar  in  purchasing  the  land  and 
developing  the  private  housing  scheme  to  be 
regulated  by  the  concerned  Zila  Councils, 
hence prays for setting aside of the impugned 
notice. 
5.  
In  the  report  and  parawise  comments 
submitted  by  NAB  authorities, 
it  has 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   4 
 
specifically  been  stated 
that 
inspite  of 
attending 
the  meeting, 
the  petitioners 
preferred 
to 
file 
instant  petitions  with 
malafide intention; the questions raised in the 
writ  petitions  involve  factual  controversies. 
Adds that under Section 3 the NAO, 1999 has 
over-riding  effect  on  other  Acts.  On  merits,  it 
is  submitted  that  keeping  in  view  the  gravity 
of  the  matter,  chairman  NAB  constituted  the 
“prevention  Committee”  vide  noting  dated 
25.05.2012 
  with  a  mandate  mentioned 
therein,  pursuant  thereto,  list  of  the  illegal 
housing  schemes/societies  was  called  from 
the  regulators  and  it  transpired  that  751 
housing  schemes/societies  were  illegal,  un-
approved  or  are  un-processed.  Since  the 
petitioner/society had committed the violation 
of  relevant  rules  and  regulations,  therefore, 
they  were  called  up  for  the  investigation  to 
determine  the  extent  of  illegal  activities  and, 
therefore,  prays  for  dismissal  of  the  writ 
petition. 
6.  
In  the  reply  submitted  by  the  LDA,  it 
was  stated  that  LDA  acted  on  the  notice 
issued  under  Section  33-C  read  with  Section 
27  of  NAO,  1999.  They  issued  a  performa  to 
the housing societies to provide the necessary 
information  and  also  prays  for  dismissal  of 
the writ petition.

Arguments heard. File perused. 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   5 
 
8.  
In  the  present  writ  petition,  the 
question of extension of jurisdiction/issuance 
of notice by the LDA officials to the petitioners 
requiring  certain 
information  has  been 
challenged.  The  stand  taken  by  the  NAB  is 
that  it  is  exactly  within  the  scope  of  Section 
33-C  and  27  of  NAO,  1999.  For  convenience, 
said sections are reproduced as under:- 
to  seek 
27.      Power  to  seek  assistance:        The 
Chairman  NAB,  [or  an  officer  of  the  NAB 
duly  authorized  by  him,]  shall  have  the 
power 
full  and  complete 
assistance  and  call 
for  all  or  any 
documents and information relevant to or 
in connection with any matter or [inquiry 
or  investigation]  pending  before  the  NAB, 
[or  disposal  of  any  property  surrendered 
to  or  seized  by  the  NAB,]  from  any 
department  of  the  Federal  Government, 
Provincial  Government,  local  authority, 
bank, financial Institution, person or any 
authority  and  institution  or  department 
in  the  public  sector  or  the  private  sector 
as  he  may  deem  it  fit  and  proper  to 
demand  or  require,  provided  that  in  any 
case  in  which  a  question  of  secrecy  in 
involved  or  is  raised  at  any  time,  the 
[Chairman NAB's] decision shall be final. 
 
A  perusal  of  the  said  section  makes  it  clear 
that  NAB Chairman  or any  authorized person 
enjoys  powers  to  seek  full  and  complete 
assistance  and  call 
for  any  information/ 
document  relevant  with  connection  to  any 
matter  pending  before  NAB 
from  any 
department,  institution  or  persons,  authority 
in  public  and  private  sectors,  but  with 
maintaining secrecy.

 Besides,  this  Court  is  guided  by    the 
observation given by the apex Court in ABDUL 
AZIZ  MEMON  and  others  versus  The  STATE 
and  others  (PLD  2013  Supreme  Court  594),  
in  respect  of  the  scope  of  NAO,  1999,  when 
compared to Ehtisab Act, 1997 with reference 
to  Section  35-C.  Relevant  extract 
from 
relevant para 12 at page 630 is reproduced as 
under;-  
and 
corrupt 
practices 
“…..  The  Preamble  to  the  Ehtesab  Act, 
1997  manifested  that  the  said  law  had 
been  enacted  only  "for  eradication  of 
corruption and corrupt practices from the 
public  offices"  whereas  the  Preamble  to 
the  National  Accountability  Ordinance, 
1999  does  not  even  mention  "public 
offices" and instead it states the objects to 
be  achieved  as  to  eradicate  corruption 
and 
hold 
accountable  all  those  persons  accused  of 
such  practices;  to  provide  for  effective 
measures  for  the  detection,  investigation, 
prosecution  and  speedy  disposal  of  cases 
involving  corruption,  corrupt  practices, 
misuse  or  abuse  of  power  or  authority, 
misappropriation  of  property,  taking  of 
kickbacks,  commissions; 
recovery  of 
outstanding  amounts  from  those  persons 
who  have  committed  default 
in  the 
repayment of amounts to banks, financial 
institutions,  governmental  agencies  and 
other  agencies;  recovery  of  State  money 
and other assets from those persons who 
have  misappropriated  or  removed  such 
money  or  assets  through  corruption, 
corrupt practices and misuse of power or 
authority;  to  seek,  obtain  or  give  mutual 
legal assistance internationally in matters 
concerning  corruption;  and  to  educate 
the  society  about  the  causes  and  effects 
of  corruption  and  corrupt  practices  and 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   7 
 
of 
the 
to  implement  policies  and  procedures  for 
the  prevention  of  corruption 
in  the 
society. It is but obvious that the scope of 
applicability 
National 
Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  is  much 
larger  than  the  scope  envisioned  in  the 
Ehtesab Act, 1997 and, thus, it would be 
na  ve  to  examine  the  former  through  the 
narrow  prism  of  the  latter.  The  stated 
object  of  the  National  Accountability 
Ordinance,  1999  was  to  rid  the  whole 
society  of  the  menace  of  corruption  and 
that  is  why  section  33C  of  the  said 
Ordinance had provided as follows: 
the 
arrange, 
develope, 
33C.  Measures  for  the  prevention  of 
corruption  and  corrupt  practices.-  The 
Chairman NAB, shall from time to time as 
he  deems 
fit,  constitute  committees 
comprising  officers  of  the  NAB  or  other 
persons or organizations from the private 
or public sectors to— 
(a) educate and advise public authorities, 
holders  of  public  office  and 
the  
large  on  measures  to 
community  at 
combat corruption and corrupt practices; 
(b) 
supervise, 
participate  in  or  conduct  educational 
programmes  or  media  campaigns,  and 
generally  to  disseminate  information  on 
the  detrimental  effects  of  corruption  and 
corrupt  practices  and  the  importance  of 
maintaining 
integrity  of  public 
administration; 
(c)  examine  the  laws  in  force,  and  also 
rules  and  regulations  relating  to  the 
practice  and  procedure  of 
various 
ministries,  departments  of  the  Federal 
Government  or  Provincial  Government, 
statutory  or  other  public  corporations  or 
bodies,  and  the  conduct  of  holders  of 
public 
recommend 
to 
amendments 
laws,  rules  or 
regulations,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  order 
to  eliminate  corruption  and  corrupt 
practices; 
(d) 
instruct,  advise  and  assist  any 
statutory  or  other  public  corporation  or 
bodies  or  upon  request,  any  organization 
in  the  private  and  public  sector  on 
measures 
and 
elimination  of  corruption  and  corrupt 
practices; and 
reduction 
in  such 
office 
and 
the 
for 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   8 
 
(e)  monitor  the  implementation  of  the 
instructions  and  advice  as  aforesaid  and 
to  assess  and  evaluate  the  success  or 
otherwise of such instructions and advice 
on  the  reduction  and  elimination  of 
corruption and corrupt practices.” 
 
10. 
Perusal  of  the  said  section  33-C(d) 
reveals that committees can be constituted by 
Chairman  NAB  of  other  organizations  from 
public  or  even  private  sector  to  assist,  advise 
on  measures  for  reduction  and elimination  of 
corruption  and  corrupt  practices.  In  our 
considered  opinion,  Section  33-C  has  to  be 
interpreted  dynamically 
for  prevention  of 
corruption and corrupt practices and to check 
this menace and to act as a whistle blower for 
the good of our society. Admittedly, no inquiry 
under  Section  19  of  NAO,  1999  is  pending 
before  the  respondent/  NAB.  It  is  also  not 
denied  by 
the  petitioners 
that  housing 
schemes  were  developed  on  agricultural  land 
without  approval  of  the  LDA  or  the  relevant 
Zila/Local  Councils.  Avoiding  any  meeting 
with  the  LDA  raises  certain  questions  on  the 
conduct  of  the  petitioners.  Even  otherwise, 
perusal of the questionnaire reveals that LDA 
wants  to  update  itself  of  certain  information 
relevant for taking measures for the reduction 
and  elimination  of  corruption  and  corrupt 
practices.

In  Lahore  Development  Authority 
through  D.-G.  and  others  versus  Mrs.  Imrana 
Tiwana  and  others”  decided  and  reported  as 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   9 
 
(2015 SCMR 1739), it has not been held that 
LDA  cannot  collect  any  information  from  the 
housing  societies  in  Lahore  Division  but  it 
laid down that if there is any conflict between 
LDA  and  the  local  Council,  it  will  be  resolved 
according  to  the  prevailing  laws.  Para  74  of 
the 
judgment 
is 
reproduced 
for 
ready 
reference:- 
the 
lies 
from 
The  solution,  therefore, 
“74. 
in 
reading the provisions of the two statutes in 
harmony.  The  LDA  Act,  1975  is  to  be 
regarded  as  an  enabling  statute.  It  allows 
LDA to act in support of and to complement 
the  Local  Government  in  the  exercise  of  its 
functions  and  responsibilities.  Where  the 
Local  Government  is  unable  to  act  because 
of  a  lack  of  resources  or  capacity,  or  where 
the  project  is  of  such  a  nature  that  it  spills 
over 
territory  of  one  Local 
Government  to  another  or  where  the  size  of 
the  Project  is  beyond  the  financial  capacity 
of the Local Government to execute; the LDA 
can  step 
in  and  work  with  the  Local 
Government.  Economies  of  scale,  spillovers 
and  effectiveness  are  merely  illustrative  of 
the  situations  in  which  the  LDA  can  act  in 
the  exercise  of  its  functions  to  carry  out 
developmental  and  other  work  and  perform 
its  statutory 
functions.  These  are  not 
exhaustive.  Life  and  time  may  throw  up 
other  situations  and  create  circumstances 
which  may  warrant  LDA  action  to  be  taken 
in  consultation  with  the  Local  Government 
within  the  purview  of  PLGA,  2013.  Closing 
the  categories  today  will  freeze  growth  and 
retard progress.” 
 
The  pendency  of  the  other  referred  writ 
petitions  will  not  affect 
the  present 
proceedings  as 
in  the  present  case  the 
information  is  sought  from  the  petitioners  on 
the  basis  of 
letter 
issued  by  the  NAB 
authorities under Section 33-C of NAO, 1999.  
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   10

The 
accountability 
laws  neither 
monitor  functionality  of  the  departments  nor 
they even supervise or control the decisions of 
the  government  and  its  agencies.  However, 
these 
laws 
introduce 
certain 
essential 
precautionary  measures  which  may  facilitate 
the  functionaries  to  play  the  role  of  whistle 
blowers  to  rule  out  or  at  least  minimize  the 
possibility 
of 
corruption 
and 
corrupt 
practices.  Accountability  is  one  of  golden 
concepts  which  no  one  can  oppose  since  it 
guides  in  preparing  policy  documents  and  in 
the  political  discourse  tends  to  show  the 
image  of  transparency  and  trustworthiness. 
The  accountability  starts  from  accounting 
(book  keeping).  It  ensures  fair  and  equitable 
governance  as  the  authorities  are  ultimately 
held  accountable  by  the  citizens.  The  shift 
from  financial  accounting  to  performance 
auditing  and  public  accounting  has  been 
observed  in  almost  all  developed  countries 
with  high  speed.  Accountability  is  an  icon; 
both  instrumental  and  goal.  Accountability  is 
either  broad  or  narrow.  It  is  a  conceptional 
umbrella  and  used  as  a  synonym 
for 
transparency,  equity,  democracy,  efficiency, 
and  responsibility.  Accountability  is  used 
interchangeably  with 
good 
governance. 
However, accountability in the broad sense is 
a  concept  without  specific  termination  of 
boundaries. Accountability is not just another 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   11 
 
political  catchword,  it  also  refers  to  complete 
practice  of  account  giving.  In  the  narrow 
sense,  accountability  refers  to  specific  set  of 
social relations. Accountability, therefore, can 
be defined as a relationship between an actor 
(individual  or  an  organization)  and  a  forum; 
the  actor  has  to  explain  his  conduct  whereas 
the forum can pose questions, pass judgment 
including 
imposition  of  sanctions.  The 
relationship between the actor and the forum 
is crucial as the former is supposed to inform 
the 
later  about  the  performance,  tasks, 
outcomes and procedures.  
  The  conduct  of  public  functionaries  varies 
from  budgetary  scrutiny  to  administrative 
fairness in the context of legal accountability. 
Such  conduct  involving  interrogation  and 
questioning  the  adequacy  of 
information 
would  establish  a  connection  between 
accountability  and  answerability.  To  qualify 
the  public  accountability,  there  should  be  a 
public accessibility of account. Accountability 
is  also  about  prevention.  Accountability  is  to 
be  rendered  before  many  eyes.  The  political 
accountability  within  democracy,  is  exercised 
alongwith  chain  of  principal-agent  i.e.  voters 
delegate 
their 
sovereignty 
to  popular 
representative,  who  in  turn,    at  least  in 
parliamentary  democracies,  delegate  their 
authority to cabinet of Ministers who delegate 
many  of  their  powers  to  civil  servants  or 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   12 
 
independent, 
administrative 
bodies. 
The 
mechanism  of  political  accountability  operates 
precisely  in  the  opposite  direction  to  that  of 
delegation.  
  The  legal  accountability  is  of  immense 
importance  because  a  great  trust  placed  in 
courts 
then 
in  parliament.  Thus 
legal 
accountability  is  the  most  un-ambiguous  as 
the legal scrutiny will be based on higher legal 
standards  prescribed  by  civil,  penal  or 
administrative  statutes  or  precedents.  The 
constitutional  perspective  of  accountability  is 
to  prevent  corruption  and  abuse  of  powers. 
Preventing 
the 
tyranny 
of 
absolute 
rulers/elected 
leaders, 
expensive 
and 
‘privatized’  executive  power.  The  independent 
judiciary 
is  placed  next 
to 
the  voter, 
parliament  and  political  officials  to  request 
that the accounts be rendered over particular 
aspects.  In  the  cybernetic  perspective  of  public 
accountability,  the  emphasis 
is 
in 
learning 
capacity 
of 
the 
public 
administrators. 
Accountability  is  useful  for  check  as  well  as  for 
prevention.  It  offers  a  regular  mechanism  to 
confront administrators with information about 
their  own  functionality  and  forces  them  to 
reflect  on  the  success  and  failures  of  their 
past policy.

The  scope  of  preventive  measures 
for  controlling  and  eradication  of  corruption 
and  corrupt  practices  has  been  hallmark  under 
different 
laws  prevalent 
in  many  countries.

In  U.K.,  Scotland’s,  France  and

W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   16 
 
Corruption  was  established  in  1974  with  a 
mandate  to  pursue  corrupt  through  effective 
detection 
and 
investigation 
eliminating  
opportunities  for  corruption  by  introducing 
corrupt-resistance  practices  and  educate  the 
public  on  the  harms  of  corruption  and  faster 
their 
support 
in 
fighting 
corruption. 
In 
Singapore,  Corrupt  Practices 
Investigation 
Bureau  established  in  1952  also  prescribes  for 
prevention  of  corruption  by  examining 
the 
practice  and  procedure  in  the  public  services  to 
minimize  the  opportunities  of  corrupt  practices. 
In  Croatia,  Office 
for  the  suppression  of 
Corruption  and  Organized  Crime  established 
in  2001,  also  prescribes  preventive  functions 
and  is  responsible  for  international  cooperation 
and  exchange  of 
information 
in  complex 
investigation.  In  France,  Central  Service  for 
Prevention  of  Corruption  increasingly  provides 
training  and  assistance  on  code  of  conduct  for 
public  and  private  enterprises.  The  above 
example  shows  that  prevention  of  corruption 
is essential for accountability laws.  
  Besides,  we  have  also  noticed  that  NAB, 
Punjab  is  conducting  inquiries  in  respect  of  20 
Housing  Schemes on  the  allegation  of  corruption 
and corrupt practices and misuse of authority 
which shows growing tendency of un-witnessed 
alluring 
the 
public-at-large 
seizing 
opportunities  to  exploit  the  weaknesses  of 
poor  and 
ignorant,  hence 
the  need  of 
preventive/precautionary steps. 
W.P. No. 189554/2018                                                   17 
 
  The  above  valuable  research  was  provided 
by  the  Research  Cell  of  Lahore  High  Court 
which is much appreciable. 
13. 
To  our  considered  view,  NAB  has  not 
directly proceeded against the petitioners and 
that  consequent 
to  certain 
information 
provided to them by the petitioners, they may 
or  may  not  directly  proceed  against  the 
petitioners.  This  Court  at  this  stage,  cannot 
stop  the  respondent/NAB 
from  collecting 
information  which  may  be  relevant  to  the 
allegation of corruption and corrupt practices. 
14. 
For  the  above  stated  reasons,  these 
writ  petitions  have  been  found  meritless  and 
are, therefore, dismissed.
