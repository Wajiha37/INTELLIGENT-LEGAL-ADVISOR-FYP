===== 
Through  this  petitioner  under  Section  497 
Cr.P.C.,  petitioner  Bashir  Ahmad  has  sought  post 
arrest bail in case FIR No.270 dated 30.05.2015, in 
respect  of  offences  under  Sections  302,  109  &  34 
PPC,  registered  at  Police  Station,  Alpa  District 
Multan. 
2. 
The  allegation  against  the  petitioner,  as 
contained in the crime report, is that on 29.05.2015 
at  Maghrib  time,  he  alongwith  his  co-accused 
Shaukat  alias  Kalu,  while  armed  with  clubs, 
launched murderous assault upon Khadim Hussain, 
father  of  the  complainant  giving  club  blows  on 
different  parts  of  his  body.  Khadim  Hussain 
succumbed to the injuries on the same day.  Hence, 
this case was registered.   
3. 
I  have  heard 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
petitioner,  learned  Deputy  Prosecutor  General 
appearing for the State assisted by learned counsel 
for  the  complainant  and  have  perused  the  record 
with their able assistance.  
4. 
It would not be out of place to mention here 
that this is the 2nd petition  on  the  subject,   earlier 
Crl. Misc. No.6138-B/2017

Crl. Misc. No.4784-B of 2016 was dismissed for non-prosecution vide 
order dated 25.10.2016.  The petitioner has sought his release on bail 
on merits as well as on the statutory ground of delay in conclusion of 
the trial.  
5.  The  occurrence  in  issue  had  taken  place  on  29.05.2015,  which 
was reported to the police on the next day on 30.05.2015 without any 
plausible  explanation.  The  petitioner  was  saddled  with 
the 
responsibility of giving club blows at the head, left arm, left shoulder 
and  left  forearm  of  deceased  Khadim  Hussain  whereas  co-accused 
Shaukat alias Kalu had allegedly given a club blow at his left  side of 
neck.  The post mortem examination report shows three injuries on the 
dead body and the opinion with regard to the cause of death remained 
uncertain  even  after  receiving  the  report  of  Punjab  Forensic  Science 
Agency.  The petitioner was arrested in this case on 15.07.2015 after   
1  ½  months  of  the occurrence  and  during  investigation, the  recovery 
of  a  club  is  shown  to  have  been  effected  at  his  instance,  which  was 
neither  blood  stained  nor  tainted  one  and,  thus,  its  evidentiary  value 
will  be  determined  by  the  learned  trial  court  after  recording  the 
evidence.  The  complicity  of  the  petitioner,  in  the  commending 
circumstances, requires further probe and inquiry into his guilt under 
subsection (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C.  
6. 
In  compliance  of  this  Court’s  order  dated  13.11.2017,  learned 
trial  Court  has  submitted  a  report  dated  21.11.2017,  stating  that  the 
challan was submitted for trial on 02.03.2016 wherein after availing a 
number  of  opportunities, 
the  prosecution  got 
recorded 
the 
examination-in-chief  of  three  witnesses  but  they  did  not  turn  up  for 
the purpose of cross-examination on two dates of hearing.  Thereafter, 
the  complainant  filed  a  private  complaint  on  21.04.2017  with  the 
delay of about two years of the occurrence wherein, after framing of 
the  charge  on  29.06.2017,  the  case  remained  adjourned  due  to  the 
non-availability  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  and once  on  account  of 
non-availability of the learned defence counsel i.e. 28.10.2017.  Now 
the  case  is  being  fixed  for  recording  the  statements  of  prosecution 
witnesses.  Learned counsel for the complainant submits that the trial

is at the advance stage as only the statement of investigating officer is 
left  to  be  recorded.    The  grant  of  bail  to  an  accused,  even  at  an 
advance stage of the trial, has no bar and the accused cannot be kept 
in  the  incarceration  even  for  a  moment, if  he  is  otherwise  entitled to 
the  relief  claimed  for  because  the  liberty  is  a  fundamental  right  of 
every  citizen,  which  cannot  be  curtailed  merely  on  the  ground  of 
technicalities.    The  petitioner  is  behind  the  bars  for  a  continuous 
period  of  more  than  2  ½  years  from  the  date  of  his  arrest  i.e. 
15.07.2015. The delay of more than 2 ½ years by itself is a sufficient 
and  tenable  ground  to  release  the  petitioner  on  bail.  Considering  the 
above  noted  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,  besides  merits,  the 
petitioner has earned the right of his release on post arrest bail on the 
ground of statutory delay in the conclusion of trial. 
In view of what has been discussed above,  the petition in hand 
is  allowed  and  the  petitioner  is  admitted  to  bail  subject  to  his 
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (rupees two lac) with 
two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
