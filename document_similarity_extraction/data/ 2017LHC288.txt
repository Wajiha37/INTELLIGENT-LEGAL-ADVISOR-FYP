Relations Ordinance, 2002 (hereinafter to be referred 
as  IRO  2002)  putting  a  challenge  to  Voluntary 
Separation  Scheme  (VSS)  dated  15.11.2007.  The 
learned  Single  Member  of  the  Commission,  vide 
order  dated  12.09.2009,  accepted  the  said  petitions 
against which the appeals filed by the Company were 
dismissed  by 
the

the 
Commission,  vide  order  dated  12.05.2015;  hence 
these petitions. 
3.  While opening his arguments, learned counsel 
representing 
the  Company,  submits 
that  after 
exercising 
their  option 
for  VSS 
the  private 
respondents  were  estopped  to  file  any  proceedings 
before 
the  Commission; 
that  as 
the  private 
respondents  were  no  more  in  service,  at  the  time  of 
filing  Grievance  Petitions  before  the  Commission, 
the  same  were  not  maintainable;  that  according  to 
Regulation No.32 of the National Industrial Relations 
Commission (Procedure and  Functions)  Regulations, 
1973  (hereinafter  to  be  referred  as  the  Regulations 
1973),  jurisdiction  of  the  Commission  was  only 
attracted  when  the  proceedings  were  covered  under 
section  25-A,  34  or  section  23  of  the  Industrial 
Relations Ordinance, 1969 (hereinafter to be referred

filed by the private respondents shows that they were 
not  exact  about  the  name  of  their  respective  Unions 
nor they pin-pointed any unfair labour practice on the 
part of the company; that at the relevant time private 
respondents could approach the Labour Court against 
termination  of  their  services;  that  bona-fide  on  the 
part  of  the  company  is  manifest  from  the  fact  that 
after  introduction  of  VSS  total  29,999  employees 
opted for that out of them 29,876 employees accepted 
their  emoluments  without  any  reservation;  that  the 
private  respondents  approached  the  Islamabad  High 
Court  against  an  interim  order  whereupon  the 
company  was  directed  to  pay  their  monthly  salaries 
in advance with the condition that the same would be 
subject to adjustment according to the final verdict of 
the  Commission.  In  support  of  his  contentions 
learned counsel has relied upon the cases reported as 
Mustehkum  Cement  Limited  through  M.D.  V.  Abdul 
Rashid  and  others  (1998  PLC  172),  Trustees  of  the 
Port of Karachi v. Muhammad Saleem (1994 SCMR

Conversely,  learned  counsel  representing  the 
private  respondents,  while  defending  the  impugned 
verdicts  of  the  fora  below  submits  that  as  the 
Regulations  1973  have  already  been  repealed  no 
reliance  can  be  placed  on  them;  that  according  to 
Regulation  No.32(2),  a  grievance  petition  before

NIRC  was  maintainable  in  respect  of  any  future

54  deals  with  similar  situation;  that  as  private 
respondents  were  being  paid  salary  at  the  time  of 
pendency of proceedings before NIRC their petitions 
were  maintainable  and  no  exception  can  be  taken 
against verdicts of the fora below on the ground that 
after 
termination  of 
their  services 
the  private 
respondents could not approach the Commission; that 
as  VSS  was  not  voluntary  rather  employees  were 
compelled to opt for the same while compelling them 
on  one  pretext  or  the  other,  same  was  rightly 
challenged  by  the  private  respondents  before  the 
Commission;  that  the  Company,  with  a  view  to 
penalize the employees and to have maximum benefit 
from  VSS 
introduced  various  categories  of 
employees  inasmuch  as  some  were  held  surplus  and 
others were declared “Not Needed” etc.; that as not a 
single  penny  was  transferred  in  the  account  of  the 
private  respondents  they  were  competent  enough  to 
agitate their grievance before the Commission.  
5. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  while 
exercising his right of rebuttal, has referred to cross-
examination  conducted  on  the  private  respondents

and  submits  that  as  they  themselves  admitted  that 
their  services  were  terminated  they  could  not  claim 
anything  on  the  strength  of  order  passed  by  the 
Islamabad  High  Court;  that  as  salary  being  paid  to 
the private respondents was subject to  final outcome 
of  the  matter  before  the  Commission  said  fact  does 
not  lend  any  support  to  the  plea  of  the  private 
respondents  that  they  were  in  service  at  the  time  of 
institution  of  proceedings  before  the  Commission; 
that according to section 88(b) of IRA 2012 the rules 
have been protected and in terms of section 2(46) of 
the  General  Clauses  Act,  1897  Regulations  fall 
within the category of rules, thus, the Regulations of 
1973 are still operative. 
6. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable  length  and  have  also  gone  through  the 
documents  annexed  with  these  petitions  as  well  as 
the case-law cited at the bar. 
7. 
Firstly  taking  up  the  most  pivotal  question 
regarding maintainability of the petitions filed by the 
private  respondents  before  the  Commission,  I  am  of 
the view that as the same were filed in terms of IRO, 
2002, the definition of worker/workman given in the 
 
 
W.P. No.28277 of 2015.

S.No. of order/

Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
parties or counsel, where necessary 
 
said  statute  is  of  paramount  consideration.  The  said 
terms  has  been  defined  under  section  2(xxx)  of  the 
said Ordinance in the following manner: - 
is 
in 
employed 
either  directly  or 
"worker"  and  "workman"  means  any  and  all 
persons  not  falling  within  the  definition  of 
employer  who 
an 
establishment or industry for remuneration or 
reward 
through  a 
contractor,  whether  the  terms  of  employment 
be express or implied, and  for the purpose of 
any  proceeding  under  this  Ordinance  in 
relation  to  an  industrial  dispute  includes  a 
person  who  has  been  dismissed,  discharged, 
retrenched,  laid-off  or  otherwise  removed 
from  employment  in  connection  with  or  as  a 
consequence  of 
that  dispute  or  whose 
dismissal,  discharge,  retrenchment, lay-off or 
removal  has  led  to  that  dispute  but  does  not 
include any person who is employed mainly in 
a  managerial  or  administrative  capacity.” 
(emphasis provided). 
According  to  the  afore-quoted  definition  clause,  a 
worker/workman  could  approach  NIRC  when  his 
services  were  dispensed  with  in  either  shape  as  a 
result of industrial dispute. Insofar as case in hand is 
concerned, the private respondents put a challenge to 
VSS  introduced  by  the  department  for  voluntary 
separation.  In  this  backdrop,  termination  of  private 
respondents  cannot  be  considered  as  a  result  of  any 
industrial  dispute  especially  when  they  failed  to 
specify  the  industrial  dispute  which  resulted  into 
termination of their services.

It  is  imperative  to  note  that  on  the  one  hand 
the  private  respondents  have  taken  plea  that  as  they 
had  been  receiving  salaries  from  the  Company  they 
could not be termed as terminated employees but on 
the other  while  appearing in the  witness box, during 
the  course  of  cross-examination,  they  admitted  that 
their  services  were  terminated.  Even  otherwise,  the 
order  passed  by  Islamabad  High  Court  renders  it 
crystal  clear  that  the  amount  directed  to  be  paid  by 
the Company to the private respondents, being in the 
shape of advance, was subject to the final outcome of 
the matter pending before the Commission. 
9. 
It  is  also  important  to  observe  over  here  that 
during  the  course  of  cross-examination  the  private 
respondents,  while  appearing  in  the  witness  box, 
admitted  that  prior  to  filing  of  their  Grievance 
Petitions  the  matter  was  also  agitated  by  the  Union 
regarding  validity  of  VSS  which  was  dismissed.  In 
the  wake  of  such  clear  cut  stance  of  the  private 
respondents,  the  Commission  was  supposed  to  be 
more  vigilant  as  after  dismissal  of  the  petition  filed 
by  the  Union  how  the  matter  agitated  by  the 
individuals could be blessed with acceptance.

Learned 
counsel 
representing 
private 
respondents has taken unequivocal stance that as the 
Regulations  1973  were  formulated  pursuant  to  IRO 
1969, after repeal of the said Ordinance same are no 
more  alive.  The  said  plea  cannot  be  given  any 
weightage for the reason that in view of saving clause 
provided  under  section  88(b)  of  IRA  2012  the  said 
Regulations  cannot  be  considered  as  redundant. 
Moreover, when learned counsel representing private 
respondents  is  relying  upon  Regulation  No.30(2)  of 
the Regulations 1973 to argue that the petitions could 
be filed by the private respondents even in respect of 
a  future  unfair  labour  practice,  he  has  no  cheeks  to 
maintain 
that  after 
repeal  of 
IRO  1969 
the 
Regulations 1973 are no more in the field. If the said 
regulations  were  no  more  available,  regulation 
No.32(2) cannot be revived in isolation. 
11. 
It  is  admitted  position  that  with  a  view  to 
invoke the provisions of IRO 2002 it was incumbent 
upon  the  private  respondents  to  establish  unfair 
labour  practice  on  the  part  of  the  Company.  While 
filing  their  petitions  before  the  Commission  no 
specification  regarding  unfair  labour  practice  was 
given  by  them  meaning  thereby  that  the  same  were

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

filed on general grounds. As the Grievance Petitions 
were filed by the private respondents in terms of IRO 
2002,  the  meaning  of  unfair  labour  practice  is  to  be 
considered with specific reference to section 63 & 64 
of the said Ordinance. As per section 63 ibid, when a 
penal  order  is  passed  against  an  employee  for  the 
reasons  mentioned  therein,  the  same  amounts  to 
unfair labour practice on the part of the employer. As 
far as the case in hand is concerned, when the private 
respondents  failed  to  establish  the  industrial  dispute 
which  ultimately  resulted  into  termination  of  their 
services,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Commission  in  their 
matter was totally barred. 
12. 
Learned  counsel  for  private  respondents  has 
vociferously  argued  that  with  a  view  to  compel 
employees to opt for VSS the Company divided them 
under different categories. There is no cavil with the 
preposition that employees were grouped in different 
categories  viz.  “redundant”  and  “surplus”  etc.  but 
when there was no reference to said terms  in VSS it 
was optional for the employees either to accept or to 
reject the same. As the private respondents exercised 
their option for VSS they could not agitate the matter

earlier option. 
13.  Undeniably,  a  serving  employee  or  an 
employee  whose  services  have  been  dispensed  with 
as a result of an industrial dispute can only agitate his 
grievance before the Commission whereas the private 
respondents having been terminated from service did 
not  fell  within  the  definition  of  workman.  The  said 
fact escaped notice of the fora below while deciding 
the matter of the private respondents. 
14. 
The  prime  ground  urged  by  the  private 
respondents in their petitions before the Commission 
was  that  with  a  view  to  deprive  them  from  revised 
pay  scales  they  were  compelled  to  opt  for  VSS.  In 
this regard, I am of the view that since VSS is silent 
about  such  element  or  the  private  respondents  were 
not  able  to  make  out  that  prior  to  exercising  option 
by  them  they  were  proceeded  departmentally  or  any 
other action was taken against them. 
15. 
For what has been discussed above, I have no 
doubt to hold that the Commission lacked jurisdiction 
in  the  matter  of  the  private  respondents  and  after 
exercising their option for VSS they were estopped to 
 
 
W.P. No.28277 of 2015.

shall stand dismissed.
