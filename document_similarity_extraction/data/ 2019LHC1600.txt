JUDGMENT 
ASIM  HAFEEZ,  J.:-  This  judgment  shall  also  decide  inter-
connected Intra Court Appeals (ICAs) No.621 of 2014 & 684 of 2014 
(appeals). All these appeals arise out Judgment dated 12.05.2014, by 
the learned Single Judge in chambers in Writ Petitions No. 14-R/2012 
and 82-R/2012, whereby order dated 30.12.2011 by respondent No.1 
was set-aside. ICA No.684 of 2014 was filed by one Mr. Shaukat Ali 
against  the  order  of  dismissal  of  application  under  Order  1  Rule  10 
Code of Civil Procedure 1908, on 12.05.2012. 
2.   We  can  trace  the  history  of  the  case  from  the  opening 
paragraphs of order dated 30.01.2010, which facts are by and large 
not  disputed.  The  Member  (Judicial-1)  Settlement  Commissioner 
decided  the  case  titled  as  “Muhammad  Akram.  etc  vs  Muhammad 
Afzal  /  AC/DSC(L)  vide  order  dated  13.12.2003,  wherein  excess 
allotment was cancelled from the name of Chand Bibi and land was

ordered  to  be  resumed  in  favour  of  the  provincial  government.  For 
reference, the order dated 13.12.2003 is reproduced hereunder; 
“In  view  of  the  position  discussed  above,  the  excess 
allotment      in  village  Qila  Sahib  Singh  has  since  been 
cancelled from the name of Chand Bibi in the connected 
case titled “Mst. Naziran Bibi, etc. vs. Muhammad Fazal, 
etc.” decided today. The allotment of land measuring 37 
kanals 10 marlas bearing Nos. 363, 404, and 405 made by 
AC/DSC(Land), Hafizabad in the name of Mst. Chand Bibi 
is  obviously  without  any  entitlement  and  has  no  legal 
value in the eye of law. The same is also hereby ordered 
to be cancelled. The District Officer (Revenue), Hafizabad 
is directed to implement this order and resume the said 
land allotted to Mst. Chand Bibi in Village Khaurlanwala 
in  favour  of  the  State.  So  far  as  the  petitioners  are 
concerned, they are directed to submit fresh application 
for  this  purpose  on  the  basis  of  their  continuous 
possession in terms of Section 3 of the Repeal Act 1975, 
after  the 
is  resumed  by  the  District  Officer 
(Revenue)/DSC  (L),  Hafizabad  in  favour  of  the  State.  A 
copy of this order be also sent to Secretary (S&R)/SC(L) for 
information and necessary action”.

Order  dated  13.12.2003  was  impugned  through  Writ  Petition

No.61-R/2004  before  the  Lahore  High  Court  Lahore,  by  the 
subsequent vendees, claimed to have purchased land from the legal 
heirs of Chand Bibi, and the persons aggrieved of order of cancellation 
of excess evacuee land. The petition was disposed of in terms of order 
dated 11.11.2008, which is reproduced hereunder; 
 
All the Writ Petitions are accordingly disposed of with the 
observations  that  the  findings  recorded  by  the  learned 
respondent NO.1 in the impugned order that Chand Bibi 
was  entitled  only  to  45  units  and  consequently  to  the 
allotment  of  proportionate  land  is  up-held.  The  learned 
respondent No.1 or his successor-in-office shall calculate 
and  adjust  the  resumed  land  to  be  allotted  against  the 
said 45 units and adjust the same against the sales made 
by the LR of Mst. Chand Bibi. The petitioners shall also be 
entitled to file applications to be considered alongwith the 
applications of respondents No.2 to 6 in terms of section 
ICA # 620-14

In compliance of the order dated 11.11.2008, the respondent 
No.1, in case bearing No. CSC Case No.118/2009 passed order dated 
30.01.2010, relevant portion whereof is reproduced hereunder;

5.  
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
perused  the  relevant  record.  In  compliance  with 
the  order  of  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  dated 
11.11.2008  passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.61-R/2004 
the allottee was entitled to only 45 PIUs seniority 
wise in favour of the petitioners. Ghulam Rasool, 
the petitioner being first purchaser of the allottee 
was entitled to the tune of 45 PIUs. As reported by 
District  Officer  (Rev.).  As  reported  by  District 
Officer (Rev.), Hafizabad land measuring 11 kanals 
& 09 marlas Khasra No.903/365 (6-K & 14-M), 478 
(1-K  17-M),  670/293  (12-M)  &  718/85  (2-K  6-M) 
against 44 PIUs was to be restored in favour of the 
present  petitioners,  therefore, 
is  ordered 
accordingly.  The  remaining  land  excluding  land 
measuring 11 Kanals & 09 Marlas out of total land 
measuring  103  Kanals  &  17  Marlas  is  resumed  in 
favour of state. District Officer (Rev.), Hafizabad is 
directed to implement the said order and resume 
the land in favour of Provincial Government (Sabiq 
Matrooka)

As  regards  the  application  of  the  petitioners  for 
purchase  of  the  land  under  Section  3  of  the 
Evacuee  Properties  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws 
(Repeal) Act No.XIV of 1975 in the light of orders of 
the Hon’ble Court out of 30 kanals & 05 Marlas the 
petitioners submitted an affidavit for purchase of 
the remaining land measuring 15 Kanals, 03 Marlas 
&  02  Sarsai  which  became  excess  from  their 
entitlement.  The  petitioners  are  bona-fide 
purchasers  from  the  allottee  and  have  been  in 
possession  of  the  same  since  the  purchase. 
Therefore, they are allowed to purchase the land 
measuring 15 Kanals, 03 Marlas & 02 Sarsai at the 
market  price  plus  10%  surcharge.  They  shall

The Respondent No.1 submitted application dated 03.08.2011 
to the appellant seeking purchase of evacuee land Khasra No.399, 477, 
478, 812/409 measuring 24 Kanals 12 Marlas, situated in Mouza Qillah 
Sahib Singh, Tehsil and District Hafizabad. Respondent No.1 claimed 
transfer of land, measuring 24 Kanals 12 Marlas, in its favour in term 
of  order  dated  12.05.2011  against  consideration  of  Rs.7,380,000/- 
deposited  on  02.05.2011,  which  was  mutated  through  mutation 
No.5292 dated 16.05.2011.  
6.  
It  appears  that  current  controversy  reignited  when  the 
appellant, vide order dated 30.12.2011, re-called earlier order dated 
30.01.2010, relevant portion of order dated 30.12.2011 is reproduced 
hereunder;  
“In  view  of  the  facts  as  well  as  the  law  points  stated 
above,  I  being  a  competent  authority  hereby  recall  the 
order dated 30.01.2010 passed in CSC case No.118/2009 
and quash the subsequent proceedings conducted on the 
basis  of  this  order.  I  also  declare  the  transactions  in 
favour  of  Muhammad  Azam  as  null  and  void,  ab-initio. 
However, he shall have the right to retrieve his deposited 
amount.  The  case  is  hereby  decided  with  the  following 
observations: 
 
“i) 
According  to  the  order  dated  13.12.2003  of 
Member  (Judicial-I)/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  and 
order  dated  11.11.2008  of  the  Hon’ble  High  Court,  the 
original allottee was entitled for 45 PIUs. In this way, the 
area equal to 45 PIUs which comes to land measuring 11 
kanals & 9 marlas shall be distributed amongst the most 
senior vendees from the original allottee which shall be 
determined by District Collector, Hafizabad personally. 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
 
5 
ii) 
After deducting the area measuring 11 kanals & 9 
marlas  out  of  103  kanals  &  17  marlas,  the  remaining 
evacuee  urban  land  measuring  92  kanals  &  8  marlas  is 
hereby  resumed  in favour  of  the  Provincial  Government 
(Sabiqa Matrooka) as had already been done by the then 
Member (Judicial-I)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, vide 
order  dated  13.12.2003  and  by  the  Hon’ble  High  Court 
vide judgment dated 11.11.2008.  
 
iii) 
The  most  senior  vendees  are  only  entitled  for  11 
kanals & 9 marlas as has been narrated in para (i) above. 
The  vendees  of  remaining  resumed  area  measuring  92 
kanals  &  8  marlas  are  not  entitled  for  its  purchase 
because  their  cases  do  not  fall  within  the  purview  of 
Section 3 of the Evacuee Properties and Displaced Persons 
Laws  (Repeal)  Act  No.XIV  of  1975.  The  vendees  always 
step into the shoes of their vendees. A defective title could 
not  become  perfect  as  it  was  further  transferred.  The 
dictum laid down in the judgments reported as PLJ 2011 
Lahore 202 and 2008 AC 22 are fully applicable in these 
case. The resumed land measuring 92 kanals & 8 marlas 
shall be put to unrestricted public auction by the Auction 
Committee  headed  by  District  Collector,  Hafizabad, 
Secretary (S&R), Board of Revenue, Punjab and Additional 
District Collector, Hafizabad shall be the members of the 
Auction  Committee.  The  vendees/occupants  shall  have 
the first right of purchase. The highest bid money/auction 
amount  shall  be  deposited  under  head  No.G-11226 
“Deposits in favour of the Chief Settlement Commissioner, 
Punjab” and the same shall be subject to final approval of 
Chief 
under 
rules/policy.  District  Collector,  Hafizabad  is  directed  to 
complete  the  auction  process  within  a  period  of  three 
months without fail under intimation to this Court”.

The appellant had also passed specific order on the application 
CSC Case No.755/2011 of the respondent No.1, which formed part of 
the  order  dated  30.12.2011,  relevant  part  thereof  is  reproduced 
hereunder; 
“6.   CSC  Case  No.755/2011:  The  contention  of 
Muhammad Azam s/o Muhammad Din was that the order 
dated 30.01.2010 was legally passed by this court and the 
subsequent orders and proceedings were also based upon 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
6 
facts. He argued that he was entitled for purchase of land 
measuring  24  kanals  &  12  marlas  which  was  legally 
transferred 
to  him  against  a  consideration  of 
Rs.24,00,000/- per acre and the mutation of proprietary 
rights was also sanctioned in his favour. In this way, the 
transaction in his favour had become a passed and closed 
transaction.  He  further  submitted  that  the  complaints 
were liable to be rejected. During the course of hearing, 
he was asked about the possession on the area in question 
because in the latest report, the revenue field staff never 
supported his contention regarding possession of the area 
in question but he failed to satisfy the court that he was 
in  possession  at  the  time  of  passing  the  order  dated 
30.01.2010.  In  this  way,  it  appeared  that  he  made  an 
unsuccessful  attempt  for  snatching  the  valuable  urban 
properties of the Provincial Government by concealment 
of actual facts.” 
     
8.  
Respondent  No.1  impugned  order  dated  30.12.2011  through 
Writ  Petition  No.14-R/2012,  which  petition  was  accepted  on 
12.05.2014 alongwith Writ Petition No.82-R/2012. Hence this Appeal.  
 
9.  
Through  ICA  No.  621  of  2014,  the  appellant  impugns  order 
dated  12.05.2014,  passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.  82-R/2012,  which 
petition was allowed in terms of order passed in Writ Petition No.14-
R/2012. 
 
10.  
ICA  No.  684  of  2014  was  filed  by  Mr.  Shaukat  Ali,  whose 
application  for  becoming  party  was  dismissed  on  12.05.2014.  The 
appellant allegedly claimed entitlement to bid for resumed evacuee 
land under section 3 of Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws 
(Repeal) Act 1975 (“Repeal Act”). It is pertinent to mention that Writ 
Petitioners in Writ Petition No.82-R/2014 and appellant in ICA No.684 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
7 
of 2014 were aggrieved of order dated 12.05.2011, through which land 
was allegedly allowed to be transferred to respondent No.1. 
Submissions by the learned counsel for the Appellant. 
 
11.  
Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  defended  the  order  dated 
30.12.2011,  alleging  that  excess  land  resumed  in  favour  of  the 
provincial government was sold / transferred through fraudulent and 
collusive  proceedings,  as  a  result  whereof  the  valuable  land  of  the 
Government was sold at ridiculously  low price. The learned counsel 
contends that land was sold to respondent No.1 without appreciating 
the  fact  that  land  was  not  agricultural  but  falls  within  urban 
area/boundaries.  The  learned  counsel  emphasized  that  the  learned 
single Judge in chambers had not appreciated the law and facts, while 
setting aside the order dated 30.12.2011.  
 
Submissions by the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1. 
 
12.   The learned counsel representing respondent No.1 contended 
that  no  power  of  review  was  available  to  the  appellant  in  view  of 
provisions of Repeal Act, hence the order dated 30.12.2011 is wholly 
without  jurisdiction.  Land  once  sold  /  transferred,  consideration 
whereof  had  been  accordingly  determined  and  paid,  cannot  be 
cancelled in purported exercise by the appellant, who otherwise was 
ineffective after passing of order dated 12.05.2011. On merits, learned 
counsel  contended  that  land  sold  was  agricultural,  which  was 
determined at the time of assessment of land for determining its price. 
Per  learned  counsel,  the  transfer  of  land  was  in  accordance  with 
scheme prepared for disposal of un-allotted rural/agricultural land in 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
8 
terms of section 3(1)(b) of Repeal Act, prepared by Board of Revenue 
in  this  behalf.  The  counsel  took  us  through  the  entire  record  to 
establish that all procedural requirements were fulfilled and the price, 
at  which  land  in  question,  was  accordingly  determined  and  it 
commensurate with the market price.  
Submissions  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents  in  ICA 
No.621 of 2014 and learned counsel for appellant in ICA No.184 of 
2014. 
 
13.   The learned counsel for the respondents in ICA No.621 and the 
learned  counsel  representing  appellant  in  ICA  No.684  of  2014  also 
claimed rights in the resumed land, some claiming land on the basis of 
sales made by the legal heirs of Chand Bibi and others claiming land 
on  account  of  alleged  possession  of  land.  It  was  argued  that  order 
dated  11.11.2008,  passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.61-R/2004,  was  not 
followed and land sold to respondent No.1 was fraudulent and caused 
prejudice to their rights claimed by them. No land can be sold without 
fulfilling the requirements of law.  
14.   Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
15.   At  the  outset,  we  enquired  from  the  learned  counsel  for 
respondent  No.1  that  whether  land  in  question,  i.e.  measuring  24 
Kanals  12  Marlas, was  claimed  as  purchased  from  the  legal  heirs  of 
Chand  Bibi,  the  learned  counsel  submitted  that  land  is  claimed  in 
independent  capacity,  on  the  basis  of  continuous  possession,  and 
same  was  purchased  after  resumption  of  land  in  favour  of  the 
Provincial Government – which was firstly mutated in the name of the 
government vide Mutation No.5054 dated 24.02.2010 measuring 86 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
9 
Kanals 18 Marlas 1-1/2 Sarsai -, pursuant to order dated 30.01.2010, 
of  the  appellant,  which  was  in  excess  of  entitlement  of  Chand  Bibi. 
Learned counsel, reiterated that respondent No.1 claimed entitlement 
to  land  in  lieu  of  scheme  for  disposal  of  un-allotted  evacuee  rural 
agricultural land, proposed and implemented by the Board of Revenue 
in terms of section 3 (1)(b) of the Repeal Act. According to him, land 
was  transferred  in  terms  of  order  dated  12.05.2011  passed  by  the 
appellant,  which  order  was  illegally  recalled  by  the  appellant  vide 
order dated 30.12.2011.  
16.   The crux of the submissions made before us are that appellant 
has no jurisdiction to recall its earlier order, in view of the provisions 
of Repeal Act. Additionally, it was argued that entire process / exercise 
of  sale  /  transfer  of  evacuee  land  was  collusive  and  fraudulent. 
Respondent’s No.1 counsel submitted that sale/transfer, in favour of 
respondent No.1, was in accordance with the scheme of disposal of 
land, introduced under section 3 (1)(b) of the Repeal Act.  Respondent 
No.1  claimed  proprietary  rights  over  the  land  on  the  basis  of  order 
dated 12.05.2011, pursuant to which order, land was mutated in the 
name  of  respondent  No.1  through  mutation  No.5292  dated 
16.05.2011. 
17.   Before  we  proceed  to  decide  the  matter,  it  is  expedient  to 
reproduce the order dated 12.05.2011 – foundation of the claim of the 
respondent  No.1,  which  was  recalled/reviewed  vide  order  dated 
30.12.2011 by appellant. The order dated 12.05.2011 reads as;

Board of Revenue in exercise of powers under section 3(1)(b) of the

“3.    Transfer  of  property—(1)  All  properties,  both  urban  and 
rural,  including  agricultural  land,  other  than  such  properties 
attached  to  charitable,  religious  or  educational  trusts  or

19.   We  will  examine  the  order  dated  30.01.2010,  Order  dated 
12.05.2011,  Order  dated  30.12.2011  and  Order  dated  14.05.2014 
while adjudicating upon the matter. 
Whether  the  respondent  No.1  fulfils  the  qualification  / 
eligibility benchmark? 
20.   We have examined the order of transfer dated 12.05.2011 and 
section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, it is clear that the respondent No.1, 
before claiming any alleged right in the land, had to fulfil the terms 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
12 
and  conditions  of  section  3(1)(b),  ibid,  and  conditions  of  scheme  of 
disposal of land. To ascertain the entitlement of the respondent No.1, 
it is imperative to examine documents referred by the learned counsel 
for the respondent No.1. First in the series, is application, filed by the 
respondent No.1, dated 03.08.2011 to seek transfer / sale of resumed 
evacuee land – except this application there was no other application 
/ document on record. During the course of hearing of the case, we 
confronted the learned counsel for respondent No.1 that whether any 
other  application  /  document  was  submitted  by  respondent’s  No.1 
father,  to  which  he  responded  that  certified  copies  of  Khasra 
Girdawari’s  were  attached  with  the  writ  petition  and  no  other 
document was required in the presence  of said documents. We are 
called upon to enter into this in-depth analysis of documents as fraud 
has been alleged.

In  paragraph  No.  1  of  application,  dated  03.08.2010,  filed  for 
seeking purchase of evacuee land, it was mentioned that respondent 
No.1 was in cultivating possession of the land for the last thirty years 
– which implied that he had claimed possession of the land since 1980 
[since application was filed on 03.08.2010]. In view of this admission 
whether  the  respondent  No.1  can  claim  any  benefit  of  proviso  to 
clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 3 of Repeal Act, which reads as; 
“Provided  that  agricultural  land  occupied  by  any  person 
continuously  for  four  harvests  immediately  preceding  Kharif 
1973 shall first be offered for sale to such person unless an order 
of  ejectment  has  been  passed  against  him  in  respect  of  such 
land”. 
[emphasis underlined]

22.   We have also examined the copies of Khasra Girdawari, which 
showed record since 1972-73. Respondent No.1 claimed occupation 
of 24 Kanals 12 Marlas but land appearing in these documents was less 
in measurement [as evident from the Khasra Girdawari for the years 
1972-1973, 1973-1974, 1974-1975, 1975-1976]. And Khasra Girdawari 
for  the  years  1976-1977,  1977-1978,  1978-1979,  1979-1980  are 
missing as well. It appeared that respondent No.1 does not meet the 
terms and conditions of section 3(1)(b) of Repeal Act, which essentially 
required that person claiming had to be occupy land continuously for 
four harvests immediately preceding Kharif 1973. 
23.   We had examined the report of the Patwari dated 02.09.2010, 
on  which  much  emphasis  was  laid  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent No.1, wherein it was observed that the respondent No.1 
was  in  possession  for  the  last  30-35  years  approximately,  which 
implied that as per the report the respondent No.1 or its father, as 
claimed, were in possession since 1975 – which fact alone disentitle 
respondent  No.1  in  terms  of  section  3(1)(b)  of  the  Repeal  Act.  It  is 
noted that while dismissing the application CSC Case No.755/2011 of 
the respondent No.1 had observed that the respondent No.1 was not 
in possession at the time of the passing of order dated 30.01.2010. 
24.   The  primary  condition  that  the  land  occupied  by  any  person 
continuously for four harvests immediately preceding Kharif 1973 shall 
first be offered for sale to such person unless an order of ejectment has 
been  passed  against  him  in  respect  of  such  land  is  undoubtedly  a 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
14 
condition  precedent,  to  be  met  before  determination  of  purchase 
price and other requirements.  
25.   We have also noticed that requirement of section 3(1)(b) was 
made  part  and  parcel  of  the  scheme  for  disposal  of  un-allotted 
evacuee  rural  Agricultural  Land,  which  is  evident  from  Chapter-I, 
clause  (ii)  and  Chapter-II  clause  i)  of  the  said  scheme,  which  are 
reproduced hereunder; 
C H A P T E R-I. 
In this Scheme unless the subject or context otherwise 
requires:- 
‘Occupied land’ means evacuee un-allotted land which is 
in continuous possession of the occupant for four harvests 
immediately, preceding Kharif, 1973. 
C H A P T E R-II. 
Disposal of occupied un-allotted land. 
ii) 
 
 
 
“2 (i)   That  such  Persons/has/have  been  in  actual  cultivating 
possession  thereof  for  a  period  of  at 
least  four  harvests 
immediately  preceding  Kharif  1973  upto  the  extent  of  subsisting 
holding within the meaning of the Land Reforms Regulation 1972 
i.e. 12½ acres. 
 
26.   Now 
if  the  respondent  No.1  was  unable  to  meet  the 
qualification / eligibility then whether alleged sale / transfer of land in 
its  favour  constitute  a  valid,  legal  and  legitimate  sale?  We  have 
examined the order dated 12.05.2011, wherein no such determination 
was done, to ascertain the eligibility of the respondent No.1. We, while 
hearing appeal, are constrained to take cognizance of this blatant flaw, 
wherein the factum of absence of inherent qualification / eligibility of 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
15 
the respondent No.1, under section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, to claim 
land was no where considered or appreciated. Meaningful silence by 
the  entire  hierarchy  of  the  Board  of  Revenue  raises  obvious  doubts 
qua the credibility of the transaction, which illegality culminated into 
order dated 12.05.2011, as reproduced hereinabove.  
27.   We  noted  that  such  determination  was  conspicuous  by  its 
absence  from  the  order  dated  12.05.2011,  which  material  fact 
escaped notice of the learned single judge in chambers, as well, while 
acknowledging alleged right of the respondent No.1 qua the land.  
28.   During the course of arguments, it is admitted that appellant is 
the only relevant competent authority to determine the entitlement 
and claim of respondent No.1 or any person claiming right to purchase 
land in terms of scheme for disposal of land, rural/agricultural or urban 
as the case may be.  In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that 
the  question  of  entitlement  of  respondent  No.1  in  a  context  of 
relevant  scheme  is  a  crucial  issue  which  to-date  has  not  been 
determined.  Since  the  entitlement  of  respondent  No.1  was  never 
considered or adjudged, therefore, alleged transfer or permission to 
transfer land vide order dated 12.05.2011 is void and of no legal effect.   
  
It  is  nobody’s  case  that  any  determination  was  done  or 
appeared  to  have  been  carried  out  before  passing  of  order  dated 
12.05.2011,  on  the  basis  whereof  land  was  sold/transferred  to 
respondent NO.1.  
 29.   We  observed  that  Writ  Petition  No.82-R/2012  –  order 
impugned through ICA No.621 of 2014 - was allowed on the basis of 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
16 
the  order  dated  12.05.2014,  passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.14-R/2012, 
wherein the question of the power to recall / review was subject to 
the  challenge.  The  writ  petitioners  also  challenged  the  order  dated 
12.05.2011 alongwith other orders, on the premise that benefit was 
extended  to  respondent  No.1  deceptively  and  fraudulently  at  their 
expense.   
30.   We have also examined the order dated 30.01.2010, which was 
passed pursuant  to  order dated 11.11.2008, passed in Writ  Petition 
No.61-R/2004. Said order had two parts, one relating to the order of 
resumption  of  land  measuring  86  kanals  18  Marlas  1-1/2  Sarsai, 
already mutated in the name of the  provincial government through 
Mutation  No.5054  and  other  relating  to  the  determination  of  the 
rights of the parties to claim / bid for the ownership of the evacuee, in 
terms of section 3(1) of Repeal Act– depending on the status of the 
land  -,  as  observed  in  the  order  dated  11.11.2008.  We  are  of  the 
opinion that the order dated 11.11.2008, ibid, has not been complied 
with in letter and spirit  – to the extent of entitlement of all eligible 
persons under section 3(1)(b) of the Repeat Act, 1975 – and apparently 
the sale of land to respondent No.1 is illegal and carried out without 
determination of material questions  -   touching very entitlement of 
respondent  No.1.  The  order  dated  11.11.2008  had  attained  finality 
and  implementation  thereof  was  mandatory  but  conspicuously 
overlooked,  which  was  not  adhered  to  while  passing  order  to  the 
extent of entitlement of the persons holding possession of resumed 
land and claiming eligibility to purchase under the Scheme introduced. 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
17 
31.   We  believe  that  determination  of  the  entitlement  of  the 
persons, allegedly claiming possession of the resumed land was not 
done  in  accordance  with  section  3(1)  of  the  Repeal  Act.  In  these 
circumstances,  we  disagree  with  observations  made  by  the  learned 
single  judge  in  chambers  vide  order  dated  12.05.2014,  whereby 
acknowledgement was extended to the transfer through order dated 
12.05.2011.  
32.  
Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  referred  to  various 
provisions of Repealed Act of 1975 to substantiate arguments that no 
power  to  recall-review  was  available  with  the  appellant,  which 
appears to be a correct position of law.   
33.  
In view of the facts narrated above, it appears that the issue is 
not  confined  to  the  determination  of  power  or  recall-review  of 
otherwise but involves determination of the rights of the parties vis-à-
vis the resumed evacuee land. The question arises that whether, we 
acting  as  appellate  Court  can  examine  the  orders  passed  by  the 
appellant. We are hearing this matter as appellate authority, enjoying 
all  powers  under  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction,  which  position  is 
further fortified in view of the fact that no appeal, review or revision 
was available to appellant, whose orders are amenable to jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
1973. Taking a lead from arguments of respondent No.1, since no right 
of appeal, review or revision is available against the order of appellant, 
we, are entitled to examine entire matter. Guidance, in this behalf can 
be  solicited  from  celebrated  judgments  by  Apex  Court  of  Pakistan

reported as “IMRAN ULLAH v. THE CROWN” (PLD 1954 Federal Court 
123) and “F.A. KHAN v. THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN” (PLD 1964 
SC  520).  Relevant  portion  of  IMRAN  ULLAH  v.  THE  CROWN’s  case  is 
reproduced hereunder: 
“The statutory right of appeal confers a right of re-
hearing of the whole dispute unless expressly restricted in 
scope  and  the  appellate  Court  is  not  confined  to  the 
reasons which have been given by the Court below as the 
ground of its decision. The appeal Court has to consider 
the controversy entirely afresh, both as regards facts and 
as regards law, and can substitute its own opinion in place 
of the decision taken by the lower Court.” 
Relevant  portion  of  F.A.  KHAN  v.  THE  GOVERNMENT  OF 
 
 
PAKISTAN’s case is reproduced hereunder:  
 
 
“None of these matters is res integra and in fact 
decided cases show that in respect of the nature of an 
appeal the following propositions may be regarded as 
established: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
when an appeal is filed the matter becomes 
sub-judice and is reheard by the appellate 
Court which does not Act merely as a Court 
of error; 
after there has been an appeal even though 
an appellate Court simply affirms the order 
of the original Court the only decree or 
order in existence is the order of the 
appellate Court; 
the  original  and  appellate  proceedings  are 
steps in one proceedings.” 
 
34.  We  have  examined  the  order  dated  12.05.2014,  wherein  the 
learned  Single  Judge  conspicuously  overlooked  real 
issue  of 
entitlement of respondent No.1, a Writ Petitioner before the Court, 
who was seeking entitlement on the basis of order dated 12.05.2011 
to question the jurisdiction of the appellant to recall/review its earlier 
order.  Respondent  No.1  had  not  approached  the  Court  with  clean 
hands and intended to take refuge behind, an illegal exercise by the 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
19 
appellant  to  recall  earlier  order,  without  disclosing  that  respondent 
No.1  lacked  entitlement/eligibility  –  on  the  basis  of  the  documents 
available. We cannot close our eyes to this  gross illegality, whereby 
the  alleged  entitlement  of  respondent  No.1  was  acknowledged 
without appreciating crucial fact that respondent No.1 failed to meet 
the basic requirements under section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act.  
35.   We  set-aside  the  order  dated  12.05.2014,  order  dated 
30.12.2011, order dated 12.05.2011 – which was passed and allowed 
transfer of land in favour of the respondent No.1 without examining 
and adhering to the mandate of section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act and 
fulfilment  of  conditions  of  scheme  for  the  disposal  of  un-allotted 
evacuee rural agricultural land.  
36.   We also set-aside the order dated 30.01.2010, to the extent of 
the sale / disposal of resumed evacuee land amongst the applicants / 
claimants  being  not  adhered  to  while  determining  the  rights  of 
subsequent vendees and persons claiming land on basis of continuous 
possession of land, however, the order to the extent of the resumption 
of the land to Government of Punjab is sustained.  
 37.   Consequently,  the  sale  /  mutation  of  the  resumed  land, 
including the sale / transfer to the respondent No.1 and in favour of 
the claimants, claiming land by virtue of purchase from the legal heirs 
of Chand Bibi is set-aside and declared void, being contrary to section 
3(1) of the Repeal Act, and the schemes implemented for the disposal 
of un-allotted evacuee land.  
 
ICA # 620-14 
 
 
20 
38.   We remand the matter to the appellant to examine the claims 
and determine the eligibility of each applicant, after ascertaining the 
possession and period of possession strictly in accordance with the law 
and  thereafter  decide  entitlement  and  other  matters,  including  but 
limited to the determination of the status / nature of the land (either 
it is agricultural or urban) and market price of the land, if he applicants 
meet qualification / eligibility benchmark for purchase, in lieu of their 
continuous  possession  from  the  period  specified  in  section  3(1)  of 
Repeal Act. However, it is observed that the observations made in this 
judgment  are  tentative  in  nature  and  appellant  should  decide  the 
matter  in  accordance  with  law  without  being  influenced  with  this 
judgment.   
39. The appeals are accepted in above-mentioned terms.
