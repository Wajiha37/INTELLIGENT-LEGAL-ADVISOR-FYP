judgment,  are  being  decided  together  because 
both these matters have arisen out of one and 
same judgment. 
2.  Briefly,  the  facts of  the  case  according  to 
Fard  Bayan  Exh.PF  and  FIR  Exh.PD  reported 
by Abdul Jabbar complainant are as under:- 
“on  14.12.2009  I  alongwith  Muhammad 
Riaz  (deceased)  came  to  my  brother 
namely  Niaz  Ahmad  and 
„behnoi‟ 
Muhammad Akram who were residing At 
Bakar  Mandi,  Lahore.  We  stayed  at 
night  there.  On  next  morning,  we  were 
proceeding  back  to  Pakpattan  Sharif, 
Muhammad  Akram  and  Niaz  came 
alongwith  us  up-to  Niazi  Bus  Stand.  I 
and  Riaz  boarded  on  bus.  Meanwhile 
Iqbal  and  Mushtaq  came  there  inside 
the  Bus.  When  they  saw  my  brother 
Riaz,  Mushtaq  pointed  a  pistol  at  his 
temporal region and Iqbal raised Lalkara 
that  he  would  not  be  spared  and  hold 
my  brother  from  his  collar  and  dragged 
him  down  from  bus.  Mushtaq  started 
firing  at  Muhammad  Riaz  deceased, 
which landed at Riaz, who succumbed to 
injuries  at  the  spot.  Iqbal  took  the 
benefit  of  stampede  and  fled  away  from 
the  place  of  occurrence.  Mushtaq  was 
arrested from the place of occurrence by 
police. 
the 
occurrence  is  that  wife  of  Mushtaq  Mst. 
Sajida Parveen filed a suit for dissolution 
of  marriage  and  got  divorce 
from 
Mushtaq.  Accused  had  suspicion  that 
Riaz  helped  his  wife.  In  order  to  take 
revenge  he  alongwith  his  brother 
Muhammad 
committed 
murder  of  my  brother  Muhammad  Riaz 
(deceased).  Therefore,  case  be  registered 
against the  accused  and  criminal  action 
be taken against the accused.”

registration 
of 
the 
case, 
investigation  started  and  on  completion  of  the 
same  report  under  section  173  Cr.P.C.  was 
submitted in the Court. 
4. 
Learned  trial  court  after  observing  legal 
formalities  framed  the  charge  against  the

appellant  and  his  co-accused  Muhammad 
Iqbal  (since  acquitted)  under  section  302/34 
PPC  to  which  they  pleaded  not  guilty  and 
prosecution evidence was summoned.  
5.  Medical  evidence  has  been  furnished  by 
Dr.  Ahmad  Raza  Khan  PW-2,  who  conducted 
postmortem  examination  on  the  dead  body  of 
Riaz Ahmad deceased.  
6. 
Prosecution  produced  as  many  as  10 
witnesses  and  after 
tendering  report  of 
Serologist Exh.PR, report of PFSLA Exh.PS and 
report of chemical examiner Exh.PT, closed its 
evidence  and  Faisal  Mehmood  Constable  was 
also examined as  court  witness  with  regard  to 
service  of  Naveed  Ahmad  SI  (since  died),  who 
recorded Fard Bayan of complainant. 
7.  On 
the  other  hand,  statement  of 
Muhammad Mushtaq  appellant  along  with  his 
co-accused  (mentioned  above)  was  recorded 
under  section  342  Cr.P.C,  who  refuted  the 
case  of  prosecution.  The  appellant  neither 
opted  to  appear  under  section  340(2)  Cr.P.C 
nor  produced  any  defence  evidence  and  in 
reply  to  question  “why  this  case  against  you 
and  why  the  PWs  deposed  against  you?” 
Muhammad  Mushtaq  appellant  stated  as 
under: - 
“The  deceased  Muhammad  Riaz  was  my 
first  cousin  (Khala  Zad)  whereas  I  was 
married  with  Sajida  Parveen 
(Paternal 
Cousin).  Two  sons  were  born  during  my 
marriage.  Muhammad  Riaz  deceased 
abducted my wife from my house and I had 
two minor children at that time who are still 
residing in my house with my parents. I got 
registered  FIR  No.930  on  18.11.2009  u/s 
496-A  389  PPC  in  P/S  Saddar,  Pakpattan 
against  Muhammad  Riaz  deceased. 
Muhammad  Riaz  deceased  was  killed  in

in 
taken 
the  SIM  of 
Niazi  bus  stand,  Lahore  and  the  alleged 
witnesses  did  not  witness  the  occurrence. 
The  police  took  the  dead  body  of  the 
the  P/S  and  a  mobile 
deceased 
alongwith  SIM  was  also 
into 
possession  for  the  personal  search  of  the 
deceased.  The  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased 
were  summoned  by  the  police  through  the 
contacts  available 
the 
deceased.  The  occurrence  took  place  early 
in  the  morning  and  the  dead  body  was 
shifted  to  P/S.  The  Rozenamcha  was 
stopped  and  on  the  following  day  of  the 
occurrence  the  FIR  was  registered.  That 
the  post  mortem 
was 
examination 
the  deceased  was 
conducted  on  the  following  day  at  noon 
time.  Due  to  previous  enmity  the  police

I  tender  the  certified  copy  of  FIR  No.930

8.  After  conclusion  of  the  trial,  learned  trial 
court  acquitted  accused  namely  Muhammad 
Iqbal  (mentioned  above)  and  convicted  and 
sentenced  the  appellant  as  mentioned  above 
through the impugned judgment. 
9. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  has 
contended that prosecution has failed to prove 
the  case  against  the  appellant;  that  cited 
eyewitnesses  who  have  appeared  during  trial 
cannot  be  relied  upon  in  peculiar  facts  of  the 
case,  being  related  to  the  deceased;  that 
motive  has  not  been  proved  and  recovery  of 
12-bore  gun  is  inconsequential  as  no  empty 
has  been  secured  by  the  investigating  agency, 
whereas learned District Public Prosecutor has 
submitted  that  appellant  is  nominated  in  the 
FIR with the specific role; medical evidence has 
confirmed  ocular  account;  prosecution  has 
proved its case up to hilt against the appellant 
and  finally  prayed  for  dismissal  of  the  appeal 
in  hand  and  confirmation  of  death  sentence

awarded  to  the  appellant  by  the  learned  trial 
Court. 
10.  After  hearing  learned  counsel  for  the 
parties  and  going  through  the  record  it  has 
been  observed  by  us  that  both  eyewitnesses 
produced  by  the  prosecution  are  not  resident 
of  the  place  of  occurrence  or  any  nearby 
vicinity  rather  they  are  resident  of  District 
Pakpattan which is at a distance of about 200 
Kilometers  from  the  place  of  occurrence;  they 
could not establish their presence at the place 
of  occurrence  by  offering  any  plausible 
explanation  or  reason  for  the  same,  so  much 
so,  ticket  of  the  bus  in  which  they  were 
statedly  sitting  could  not  be  produced  by  the 
complainant;  they  are  also  inimical  to  the 
accused  and  related  to  the  deceased  as  well.  
Since 
eyewitnesses 
produced 
by 
the 
prosecution could  not establish  their presence 
at  the  place  of  occurrence,  hence,  this 
important aspect of the case of the prosecution 
has not been proved and it is fatal for the case 
of  the  prosecution. 
  Guidance  has  been 
respectfully sought from the cases reported as 
“Irshad  Ahmad  v.  The  State”  (2011  SCMR 
1190),  “Muhammad  Rafique  v.  The  State” 
(2014 SCMR 1698), “Mst. Sughra Begum and 
another  v.  Qaiser  Pervez  and  others”  (2015 
SCMR  1142),  “Arshad  Khan  v.  The  State” 
(2017  SCMR  564),.    Furthermore,  occurrence 
took place in this case on 15.12.2009 at 09:15 
a.m.  whereas  postmortem  examination  over 
dead  body  of  the  deceased  was  conducted  on 
16.12.2009 at 11:15 a.m. i.e. after about lapse

of  26  hours  which  factor  is  sufficient  to 
establish 
that  no 
eyewitness 
including 
complainant  was  present  at  the  place  of 
occurrence  rather 
it 
is  an  un-witnessed 
occurrence  and  this  time  has  been  consumed 
by  the  prosecution  in  engaging  and  procuring 
the witnesses and tailoring story for the case of 
prosecution.  Reliance is placed on the dictum 
laid down in the case of “Shahbaz v. The State” 
(2016  SCMR  1763),  “Imtiaz  alias  Taj  vs.  The 
state  and  others”  (2018  S  C  M  R  344)  and 
“Haroon  Shafique  v.  The  State  and  others” 
(2018  SCMR  2118).  The  distance  between 
assailant and victim has been shown as 06 feet 
at  the  time  of  receipt  of  firearm  shot  by  the 
deceased and in this situation if length of arm 
is  deducted  then  there  should  be  blackening 
on  the  injuries, but  no  such phenomenon  has 
been 
found  at 
the 
time  of  postmortem 
examination.  So  medical  has  also  not 
supported ocular version.  It is also important 
to  mention  here  that  even  no  time  of 
occurrence  has  expressly  been  mentioned  on 
the  application  Exh.PF  which  was  moved  for 
registration  of  the  case. 
  After  thorough 
investigation  Muhammad  Ramzan  Inspector/ 
PW-10  concluded  that  deceased  was  all  alone 
at  the  time  of  occurrence  of  the  case  and  he 
was  not  accompanied  by  any  cited  witness  or 
complainant,  his  investigation  was  neither 
challenged 
in  police  hierarchy  nor  any 
complaint was filed in this regard.  So much so 
when  he  categorically  stated  during  his 
statement  before  Trial  Court  about  non

presence  of  cited  eye  witness  at  the  time  and 
place  of  occurrence  then  he  was  neither  re-
examined  nor  got  declared  hostile  by  the 
prosecution.    No  one  was  produced  by  the 
prosecution  to  prove  that  he  apprehended  the 
appellant  at  the  time  and  place of  occurrence.  
As  far  as  recovery  is  concerned,  suffice  it  to 
say  that  its  safe  deposit  to  the  office  of 
Forensic  Science  Laboratory,  could  not  be 
established  because  Muhammad  Ajmal  Javed 
225/HC  Moharrar/PW-4  categorically  stated 
that  on  24.12.2012  he  handed  over  parcel  of 
pistol and empties to Abdul Khaliq 1912/C for 
depositing  the  same 
in  Forensic  Science 
Laboratory,  Lahore,  similarly,  Abdul  Khaliq 
1912-C/PW-6  states  that  on  24.12.2009,  he 
after  receipt  of  parcel  of  pistol  30-bore  and 
empty  deposited  the  same  in  Forensic  Science 
Laboratory,  Lahore  but  report  of  Forensic 
Science  Laboratory,  Lahore/Exh.PM  depicts 
contrary  to  the  same  because  as  per  said 
report,  Abdul  Khaliq  1912/C  never  deposited 
said  parcel 
in  said  office 
rather  one 
Muhammad  Nawaz  7785/C  deposited  the 
same.    Hence,  report  of  Forensic  Science 
Agency,  Lahore/Exh.PM  is  of  no  avail  and, 
thus,  providing  no  help  to  the  case  of 
prosecution.    Furthermore,  pistol  and  empties 
remained  at  police  station  for  a  considerable 
period  and  dispatched  with  unexplained  delay 
which  raises  eyebrows  about  its  evidentiary 
value. 
 
As  far  as  motive  is  concerned,  though 
prosecution could not prove the motive yet it is

a  double-edged  weapon  and  cuts  both  the 
ways i.e. it could also be safely considered as a 
reason  for  false  implication  of  the  accused.    It 
is  trite  of  law  that  when  substantial  evidence 
has  been  disbelieved  then  such  like  piece  of 
evidence i.e. motive loses its evidentiary value.  
However,  in  peculiar  facts  and  circumstances 
of the case, possibility cannot be ruled out that 
it  was  reason  for  false  implication  of  the 
appellant.  Reliance is placed upon the case of 
“Tariq versus The State” (2017 SCMR 1672). 
11.  Nutshell  is  that  prosecution  has  failed  to 
prove  its  case  against  the  appellant  beyond 
any  shadow  of  doubt.    Hence,  no  need  to 
discuss  defence  version.    Resultantly,  instant 
appeal  is  allowed,  impugned  conviction  and 
sentence  passed  through  impugned  judgment 
are  hereby  set  aside,  Muhammad  Mushtaq 
appellant  is  acquitted  of  the  charge.    He  shall 
be  released  if  not  required  in  any  other  case.  
Murder  Reference  is  answered  in  negative 
and  death  sentence  of  the  appellant  is  not 
confirmed.
