Through  this  civil  revision  under  Section 
115  of  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908,  the 
petitioner  has  called  in  question  the  validity  and 
legality  of  order  dated  14.10.2013  passed  by 
learned Additional District Judge, Lahore. 
2. 
Precisely,  the  facts  of  the  case  as  narrated 
in the civil revision are that respondent No.5/Mst. 
Sarfraz Begum purchased land measuring 3 kanal 
14 marlas comprising Khasra No.179/3 and 179/4 
Min  from  Hamid  Hussain  and  Sher  Iqbal  Haider 
Zaidi  vide  registered  sale  deed  No.17807  dated 
01.10.1979.  She  applied 
for  exemption 
to 
respondents No.2 and 3/LDA and plot No.13-D/1 
measuring  1  kanal  was  allocated  and  in  this 
respect  a 
letter  No.JT/AP-1155/8181  dated 
11.07.1988  was  issued.  After  payment  of  dues, 
respondents  No.2  and  3/LDA  exempted  the  said 
plot  situated  at  M.A.  Johar  Town,  Lahore  vide 
letter  No.JT/AP-1155/9221  dated  03.08.1988  in 
favour  of  respondent  No.5  and  possession  of  the 
C.R. No.231 of 2014 
2 
said  plot  was  also  handed  over  to  her  vide  letter 
No.JT/AP-1155/9407 
dated 
08.08.1988. 
Respondent  No.5  sold  the  above  said  plot  to 
Tahir  Mahmood  Saeed/respondent  No.4  and 
respondents No.2 and 3/LDA transferred the plot 
in  his  name  vide  letter  No.JT/AP-1155/3952 
dated  25.06.1989.  The  petitioner  purchased  the 
said plot from respondent No.4 and the same was 
also  transferred  in  his  name  in  LDA  record  vide 
letter No.JT/AP-1155/87 dated 08.01.1990 and he 
took  over  the  possession  of  the  plot  in  question. 
Later on, LDA/respondents No.2 and 3 cancelled 
the  exemption  and  possession  of  said  plot  vide 
letter  No.JT/APPELLANT-1155/1218 
dated 
28.02.2000  without  hearing  the  petitioner.  On 
coming  to  know  about  the  cancellation  of  the 
plot,  the  petitioner  approached  respondents  No.2 
and  3  for  restoration  of  the  plot  in  question.  On 
refusal,  he  instituted  a  suit  for  declaration  with 
permanent injunction against respondents No.2 & 
3  and  others  before  the  learned  Civil  Judge, 
Lahore  who  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated 
31.05.2010  decreed  the  suit.  Respondents  No.2 
and  3  preferred  an  appeal  before 
learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  Lahore  which  was 
dismissed  vide 
judgment  and  decree  dated 
20.01.2011. Respondent No.1 filed an application 
under  Section  12(2)  CPC  before 
learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  Lahore  who  vide 
impugned  order  dated  14.10.2013  accepted  the 
same. Hence, this civil revision.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends 
that  the  petitioner  is  bonafide  purchaser  of  plot 
bearing  No.13-D/1,  M.A.  Johar  Town  Scheme, 
C.R. No.231 of 2014 
3 
Lahore  which  was  transferred  in  his  name  on 
08.01.1990  and  possession  was  also  delivered  to 
him;  that  after  withdrawal  of  exemption  and 
possession of said plot of the petitioner by LDA, 
the  plot  in  dispute  was  transferred  to  Syed 
Muhammad  Ilyas  in  exchange  of  plot  No.401-D 
M.A.  Johar  Town  Scheme,  Lahore  by  LDA  on 
10.03.2008  who 
further 
transferred 
it 
to 
respondent 
No.1 
(Sajid 
Hussain 
Bhatti/respondent  No.1)  vide  letter  No.JT/AP-
1055-1A44/3711  dated  12.04.2008  issued  by 
LDA  and  that  too  during  pendency  of  the  suit 
which  was 
instituted  by 
the  petitioner  on 
13.02.2006 and decreed on 31.05.2010 passed by 
learned  Civil 
Judge,  Lahore, 
therefore, 
respondent  No.1  has  no  locus  standi  to  maintain 
his  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C  as 
principle of lis pendense enshrined in Section 52 
of  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act,  1882  is  fully 
attracted.  
4. 
On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 
respondent  No.1  has  supported  the  impugned 
order. 
5. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
It 
is  an  admitted  fact 
that  petitioner 
instituted  a  suit  against  respondents  No.2  and  3 
(LDA)  and  respondent  No.5  (private  respondent) 
on  13.02.2006.  The  suit  was  vehemently 
contested  by  LDA  before  learned  trial  court  and 
by filing appeal, therefore, said department was a 
party to the litigation and was not in a position to 
transfer  the  plot  in  dispute  either  to  Syed 
Muhammad 
Ilyas 
or 
Sajid 
Hussain 
Bhatti/respondent  No.1.  The  suit  was  decreed on 
C.R. No.231 of 2014 
4 
31.05.2010. The plot in dispute was transferred to 
Syed  Muhammad 
Ilyas  vide 
letter  No. 
JT/AP/1055+1844/2377  dated  10.03.2008  by 
LDA  who 
subsequently 
transferred 
it 
to 
respondent 
No.1 
vide 
letter 
No.JT/ 
AP/1055+1844/3711  dated  12.04.2008  which 
letters  have  been  issued  in  their  favour  during 
pendency  of  the  litigation.  In  taking  the  above 
view,  reliance  is  placed  on  case  law  reported  as 
“Muhammad  Ashraf  Butt  and  others  v. 
Muhammad  Asif  Bhatti  and  others”  (PLD  2011 
Supreme  Court  905),  in  which  learned  Apex 
Court  after  discussing  the  principle  laid  down  in 
Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 
held  that  if  the  property  is  purchased  during  the 
pendency  of  litigation  then  purchaser  has  no 
locus standi to challenge the judgment and decree 
by  filing  an  application  under  Section  12(2) 
C.P.C.  Relevant  portion  of  the  judgment  is 
reproduced herein below:- 
the  property  during 
“9. Now considering the instant case in the light 
of  the  principles  mentioned  above,  it  is  clearly 
spelt  out  from  the  record  that  the  appellants 
have  purchased 
the 
pendency  of  the  suit  and  Yaqoob  son  of  Ishaq 
was a party to the suit who was duly implead as 
a  defendant  on  14-2-1980  and  had  sold  the 
property  to  Yaqoob  son  of  Khuda  Bakhsh  on  
2-4-1980 from whom the appellants via Jamshed 
acquired their title subsequently on 12-10-1984. 
In this context, it may be elucidated that Khalid 
had  sold  the  property  to  Yaqoob  son  of  Ishaq 
prior  to  the  institution  of  the  suit,  therefore,  if 
the later was not impleaded as a party, and had 
made  any  transfer  even  during  the  pendency  of 
the  suit,  such  alienation  would  not  have 
attracted  lis  pendens  as  being  not  a  party 
thereto,  but  when  the  afore-named  was  arrayed 
as a defendant on 14-2-1980, from that point of 
time he shall for the purposes of section 52 ibid 
be  the  party  do  the  suit,  and  thus  for  all 
considerations  thereof  was  the  predecessor  in 
interest  of  the  appellants,  notwithstanding  the 
fact  that  Yaqoob  son  of  Khuda  Bakhsh,  who 
himself  had  purchased  the  property  from  him 
C.R. No.231 of 2014 
5 
during  the  pendency  of  the  suit  was  made  a 
party to the suit or not. It is in this scenario that 
lis  pendens  shall  be  duly  attracted  and  the 
appellants,  shall  have  no  locus  standi  to  file 
application  under 
section  12(2),  C.P.C. 
challenging  the  decree  on  account  of  any  lapse 
in  the  impleadment  of  the  defendants,  and  thus 
there  was  no  question  for  the  recording  of  the 
evidence on this issue. In any case, as mentioned 
above,  the  appellants  would  not  acquire  any 
independent  right  to  challenge  the  said  decree 
even  on  the  score  of  being  the  bona  fide 
purchaser,  because  the  provisions  of  section  52 
ibid  are  not  subservient  to  section  41  of  the 
Transfer of Property Act or section 27(b) of the 
Specific  Relief  Act  or  the  general  equitable 
concept  of  Bona  fide  purchaser,  rather  the 
section  and  the  rule  of  lis  pendens  is  an 
exception  to  the  above  provisions/concept.  And 
the  appellants  could  only  sustain  in  their  claim 
to challenge the decree on the basis of the three 
conditions  of  section  52  mentioned  above,  but 
they  have  failed  to  make  out  a  case  within  the 
purview thereof. Before parting with the subject, 
it may be held that plea on which the leave was 
granted in the case vide order dated 18-5-2007, 
in  view  of  the  proposition  resolved  through  this 
judgment is considered to be irrelevant.” 
 
Further reliance is placed on case law reported as 
“Muhammad  Mubeen  v.  Messrs  Long  Life 
Builders  and  others”  (PLD  2006  Karachi  278). 
In  this  case,  Abdul  Hameed  instituted  a  suit  for 
specific  performance  against  Messrs  Long  Life 
Builders and his partners namely Fayyaz Ahmed, 
Ch.  Zulfiqar  Ali  Syed  Ahmad,  Muhammad 
Aleemuz  Zaman  including  that  of  Mrs.  Nayar 
Sultana  Sylani  in  the  year  1993  which  was 
decreed  on  02.12.1998  in  favour  of  Abdul 
Hameed  by  cancelling 
lease  deed  dated 
14.10.1992  executed  in  favour  of  Mrs.  Nayar 
Sultana  Sylani.  When  Abdul  Hameed  filed 
execution  petition  for  the  decree,  then  one 
Muhammad  Mubeen  filed  an  application  under 
Section  12(2)  CPC  that  he  has  purchased  the 
Bungalow  in  dispute  from  Mrs.  Nayar  Sultana 
C.R. No.231 of 2014 
6 
Sylani  in  1994.  The  learned  Judge  in  the  afore-
noted  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  while 
applying provision enshrined in Section 52 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 held as under:- 
“Under section 52 of the Transfer of Property 
Act,  no  party  to  the  suit  can  alienate  the 
disputed property so as to affect his opponent. 
A party who has obtained decree in his favour 
is  entitled  to  execute  the  decree  not  only 
against  the  person  against  whom  decree  was 
passed  but  also  against  person  who  derived 
title  to  the  disputed  property  during  the 
pendency  of  the  suit.  The  change  of  title  or 
transfer  of  possession  during  the  pendency  of 
the  suit  from  the  judgment-debtor  to  a  third 
party is to be treated only symbolical title and 
possession,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  the 
Decree Holder be not allowed to proceed also 
against  the  third  party  who  is  in  actual 
possession of the suit property. 
 
 
When a party to a suit sells disputed property 
to third party during pendency of the suit and 
ultimately he fails in establishing his title to it, 
the  purchaser  of  such  property  cannot  even 
seek  protection  of  a  bona  fide  purchaser  in 
order to deprive the decree-holder the fruits of 
the  decree.  The  third  party  in  whose  favour 
title is transferred during the pendency of suit 
by a judgment-debtor is to be regarded only a 
representative  of  the  judgment-debtor  and  the 
act  of  selling  the  property  cannot  be  allowed 
to  defeat  the  claim  of  the  decree-holders 
merely  because  the  property  changed  hands 
during pendency of the suit. This is so because 
the rule of lis pendens is applicable also to the 
third party. In such a case, he is not entitled to 
defend 
the 
judgment-debtor  through  whom  he  claimed 
ownership  rights  during  the  pendency  of  the 
suit.  The  judgment  and  decree  passed  against 
the  judgment-debtor  shall  also  be  binding  on 
the  purchaser  in  the  same  manner  and  to  the 
same extent as it was binding on the judgment-
debtor.”
