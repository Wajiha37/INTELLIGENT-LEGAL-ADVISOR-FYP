24.10.2018  Mr. Liaqat Ali Chaudhry, Advocate. 
This  order  will  dispose  of  Tax  Reference  No.86719  of 
2107 titled as “Commissioner Inland Revenue Zone-V vs. M/s 
T.N.W.  Engineering  Works”  and  Tax  Reference  No.86725  of 
2107 titled as “Commissioner Inland Revenue Zone-V vs. M/s 
T.N.W. Engineering Works” as these arise out of consolidated 
judgment relating to Tax Years 2010 & 2011.  
2. 
The key issue before us is the scope of section 133 (1)of 
the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 (“Ordinance”) and whether an 
order  passed,  by  the  Tribunal,  in  exercise  of  powers  under 
subsection (5) of Section 131 of the Ordinance is amenable to 
jurisdiction conferred on this Court under section 133(1)-ibid.  
3.  
Briefly, the facts necessary for adjudication of the lis at 
hand  are  that  return  of  income  was  taken  as  assessment  of 
taxable income for the relevant year under Section 120 of the 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17

Ordinance, which was amended subsequently  under Section 
122(1)  of 
the  Ordinance  accordingly.  Aggrieved, 
the 
respondent,  tax  payer,  filed  appeal,  against  amended 
assessment, under section 127 of the  Ordinance, which was 
dismissed  and  amendment  order  was  upheld.  Respondent, 
thereupon,  filed  appeal  under  section  131  of  the  Ordinance 
before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench 
(“the  Tribunal”).  Respondent  sought  stay  order,  which  was 
granted  vide  order  dated  20.03.2017.  Since  the  appeals 
remained  pending,  the  respondent  sought  extension  in  the 
stay orders by filling applications, M.A (Stay) No.916/LB/2017 
and  M.A  (Stay)  No.917/LB/2017.  Tribunal  extended  the  stay 
granted  vide  order  dated  26.04.2017  (“impugned  order”). 
Hence, these reference applications, filed by the department.      
4.  
At the outset, the learned counsel was confronted with 
the question of maintainability of instant reference; whether 
reference in terms of section 133 of the Ordinance can be filed, 
firstly,  against  interlocutory  order  and  secondly,  in  the 
absence of any order under sub-section (3) of Section 132 of 
the Ordinance, to be communicated under sub-section (7) of 
Section 132-ibid, which becomes amenable to the jurisdiction 
under Section 133(1)-ibid.

5.  
Learned  counsel  conceded  that  reference  applications 
were  filed  against  the  orders  passed  by  the  Tribunal,  on 
miscellaneous  applications,  seeking  extension  in  the  stay 
orders granted. Learned counsel attacked, the legality of the 
impugned order and erroneous exercise of discretion by the 
Tribunal. It was argued that order impugned was contrary to 
the  mandate  of  sub-section  (5)  of  section  131  of  the 
Ordinance.  Per  learned  counsel,  reliance  placed  by  the 
Tribunal on case reported as “Dowell Schlumberger (Wastern) 
S.A v Federation of Pakistan & others” (2016 PTD 1702) was 
misplaced.  Learned  counsel  in  support  of  contentions  relied 
upon  case 
reported  as  “Mst.  Shagufta  Abdullah  v 
Commissioner Inland Revenue & 3 others” (2015 PTD 1855). 
6. 
Heard, Available record perused.  
 
7.  
The  moot  question  involved,  for  the  purposes  of 
adjudication, is not about availability of power of the Tribunal 
to  grant  interim  order  –  such  power  is  available  with  the 
Tribunal under sub-section (5) of section 131 of the Ordinance 
-  but  whether 
impugned  order,  which 
is  otherwise 
interlocutory  in  nature,  can  be  subjected  to  a  challenge  by 
invoking section 133 of the Ordinance-ibid. Section 133, reads 
as:   
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17

“133. Reference to High Court. --- (1) within ninety days 
of  the  communication  of  the  order  of  the  Appellate 
Tribunal  under  sub-section  (7)  of  section  132,  the 
aggrieved  person  or  the  Commissioner  may  prefer  an 
application, 
in  the  prescribed  form  along  with  a 
statement  of  the  case,  to  the  High  Court,  stating  any 
question of law arising out of such order.” 
 
8.  
Literal  reading  of  section  133(1)-ibid,  suggests  that 
jurisdiction made available, thereunder, can be invoked only 
against  an  order  of  the  Tribunal  communicated  under  sub-
section (7) of section 132 of the  Ordinance and none other. 
Specific  reference  to  sub-section  (7)  of  section  132,  ibid,  is 
meaningful  and  must  be  given  effect  while  ascertaining  the 
legislative intent. The import and nature of the orders passed 
under section 131 (5) and section 132 (3) of the Ordinance are 
distinct,  which  distinction  has  to  be  acknowledged  and 
appreciated while determining the scope of jurisdiction under 
section  133-ibid.  Needless  to  mention  that  section  133-ibid, 
per-se,  draws  conspicuous  cleavage  inter-se  orders  under 
section  131  (5)  and  one  under  section  132  (3)  of  the 
Ordinance, former being in the nature of interim/interlocutory 
order,  passed  during  the  pendency  of  appeal,  and  later 
attracting status of finality, certainly subject to decision under 
section 133-ibid. A collective reading of sub-sections (3), (7) & 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17 
 
 
 
5 
(10)  of  section  132  would  fortify  the  point  that  only  “final 
order” is amenable to jurisdiction under section 133-ibid. It is 
reiterated that the order communicated, to the tax payer or 
the  Commissioner,  under  sub-section  (7)  of  section  132, 
providing  essentially 
required  eligibility 
for 
invoking 
jurisdiction of the High Court under section 133-ibid, is final for 
all  intent  and  purposes,  impregnated  with  questions  of  law 
arising out of such order. Whether finality, as envisaged under 
sub-sections (3), (7) & (10) of Section 132, can be attributed to 
the impugned order? It is evident that impugned order cannot 
be treated as final order on two counts, which are;  
i) 
The  impugned  order  was  passed  in  exercise  of 
powers  under  sub-section  (5)  of  section  131  of  the 
Ordinance; 
ii) 
The appeal was pending adjudication (at the time 
when impugned order was passed); neither any decision 
made  under  section  132  (3)  of  the  Ordinance  nor 
communicated in terms of sub-section (7) of section 132, 
ibid,  which, 
in  essence,  makes 
it  an 
interim/ 
interlocutory order”.  
 
9.  
legislative intent, expressed  through section 133, ibid, 
is  reinforced  in  a  recent  judgment  of  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Messrs Squibb Pakistan 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17 
 
 
 
6 
Pvt.  Ltd.  and  another  v  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  and 
another” (2017 PTD 1303).  
Paragraph No. 49 at page 1350 reads as….  
“An independent interpretation of section 133 of 
the  Ordinance,  2001,  as  it  stands  today,  on  the 
plain  language  of  the  law,  liberated  from  the 
burden  or  benefit  of  earlier  judgments,  would 
make  the  position  very  clear.  Sub-section  (1) 
confers a right on any person or the Commissioner 
aggrieved  by  a  final  order  of  the  Appellate 
Tribunal  to  file  an  application  before  the  High 
Court along with a statement of the case stating 
any questions of law arising out of the Tribunal’s 
order------The order being challenged is the final 
order but the challenge is  limited to question of 
law only”  (emphasis supplied) 
 
10.   The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  while 
adjudicating upon the scope of section 79 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance  1979  (as  it  stood  prior  to  Finance  Act,  1992)  has 
elucidated  the  nature/scope  of  remedy  available  by  way  of 
reference  under  section  133-ibid,  which 
is  termed  as 
“appellate” in nature. The identity, extended by the Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  to  the  nature  of  remedy  under 
section 133(1)-ibid, when read with the expression “arising out 
of  such  order”,  conclusively  establish  that  order  in  terms  of 
sub-sections  (3),  (7)  &  (10)  of  Section  132  is  final  for  the 
purposes of Section 133-ibid.   
11.   The  cases  relied  upon  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
applicant  are  distinguishable,  hence,  not  applicable  to  the 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17

facts and circumstances of the case under reference. In Dowell 
Schlumberger,  case  (supra),  constitutional  jurisdiction  was 
invoked  for  seeking  determination  of  the  scope  and 
applicability  of limitation prescribed under section 34 of the 
Federal  Excise  Act  2005,  section  46  (2)  of  the  Sales  Tax  Act 
1990,  read  with  section  131  (5)  of  the  Ordinance  of  2001– 
whether a stay order can be extended beyond a period of 180 
days, in aggregate – wherein it was held that “time specified in 
section 131 (5) is directory and, therefore, if the appeal is not 
decided within the said period, the stay would continue till the 
disposal or decision of the appeal unless expressly recalled by 
the Tribunal”.  
In  Mst  Shagufta  Abdullah’s  case  (supra)  writ  petition 
was filed to challenge order of refusal to grant stay and to seek 
stay against recovery– the case was under Sales Tax regime. 
The question raised and decided therein is not relevant to the 
issue at hand.  
12.   Before concluding the matter, it is apt to briefly discuss 
the case, decided by learned Division Bench of Islamabad High 
Court,  reported  as  “Pak  Gulf  Construction  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  v 
Commissioner  Inland  Revenue”  (2016  PTD  1061),  wherein 
reference  application  was  entertained  by  the  High  Court 
against the order of the Tribunal, refusing to stay recovery on 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17

the premise that Tribunal was not legally competent to stay 
recovery.  The  ratio  /  reason  of  the  decision  in  Pak  Gulf 
Construction case (supra) at page 1065 – reads as……  
“The right of appeal and its scope is provided under sub-
section (1) of section 131 of the Ordinance. Sub-section 
(1) extends the right of appeal to an order and not a final 
order. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the learned 
Tribunal has not properly appreciated the first proviso of 
section 131 of the Ordinance in its true perspective” - not 
applicable to the facts of this case”. 
 
13.   The principle of law enunciated in Pak Gulf Construction 
case  (supra),  is  that  the  Tribunal  had  requisite  power  to 
entertain  and  decide  application  for  stay  of  recovery  under 
sub-section 
(5)  of  section  131-ibid.  The  question  of 
maintainability of reference application against order passed 
under Section 131(5) of the Ordinance was neither raised nor 
the provisions of Section 133(1) and sub-sections (3), (7) & (10) 
of  Section  132  delineated  upon,  by  the  learned  Bench, 
therefore, the decision  therein is  distinguishable and  has no 
persuasive  value  qua  the  question,  subject  matter  of 
adjudication in this case.  
 
14.  
In  these  circumstances,  the  order  impugned  dated 
20.04.2017 – under section 131 (5) of the Ordinance – is not 
amenable to the jurisdiction, conferred on this  Court,  under 
         ITR # 86725-17 
         ITR # 86719-17

section 133(1) of the Ordinance. The reference application is 
not maintainable.  
15.  
In view of the above, reference application is dismissed 
being not maintainable.
