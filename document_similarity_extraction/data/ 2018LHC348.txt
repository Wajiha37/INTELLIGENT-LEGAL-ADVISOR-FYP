06.02.2018  Ch. Sameed Ahmad Wains, Advocate 
for the petitioners.  
 
Verily,  Samreen  Kausar,  sister  of  present  petitioners  was  owner  of 
property measuring 01 Kanal 09 Marlas, who transferred it to Amjad 
Ali  respondent  No.1 
through  execution  of  sale  deed  dated 
08.07.2006  (Exh.P5).  Though 
in  earlier  round  of 
litigation, 
Muhammad  Tariq  petitioner  No.1  pirated  the  said  sale  through  suit 
for pre-emption (Exh.D1) and one day prior to its withdrawal, suit in 
hand was filed on 14.09.2011 with the stance that property involved 
in  Exh.P5  was  in  fact  owned  by  their  father  Muhammad  Manzoor, 
who gifted it out to them through memo of gift executed on a plain 
paper dated 13.01.2006 (Exh.P1) and on the next day, earlier suit of 
pre-emption  was  withdrawn  vide  order  dated  15.09.2011  (Exh.D2). 
After  collecting  and  thrashing  evidence  of  the  parties  in  pros  and 
cons,  learned  Trial  Court  dismissed  the  suit  through  judgment  and 
decree  dated  22.01.2015.  Though  appeal  was  preferred  by  the 
petitioners well within time on 03.02.2015  yet without affixation of 
requisite  Court  fee  and  for  that  sole  ground,  the  appeal  was 
dismissed    vide  impugned  order  dated  15.12.2017,  hence  instant 
Civil Revision.

3. 
Heard. Record perused. 
Through  their  suit,  the  petitioners  claimed  themselves  to  be 
the owners of property valuing at least Rs.2000000/- on the basis of 
alleged gift  and under the law, valuation of the suit for the purposes 
of court fee was to be affixed by them as per its market price, but at 
the  time  of  its  institution,  they  fixed  its  value  for  that  purpose  only 
Rs.24000/-,  however,  subsequently  on  debriefing  of  learned  Civil 
Court  as  per  requirement  of  section  7  (iv)  (a)  of  the  Court  Fees 
C.R.No.158016 /2018 
2 
Act,1887,  the  maximum  court  fee  of  Rs.15000/-  was  furnished.  It 
was  amazing  that  after  the  dismissal  of  suit  by  the  learned  Civil 
Court,  despite  the  fact  that  while  filing  appeal,  Rs.200000/-  was 
fixed its value for that purpose, but this time again without affixation 
of any court fee. The petitioners were very much aware what stamps 
of court fee they had to furnish and no confusion was in their way in 
this regard. The submission of Ch. Sameed Ahmed Wains, Advocate 
for  the  petitioners  that  learned  lower  Appellate  Court  prior  to 
dismissal of appeal did not direct the petitioners to levy the requisite 
Court  fee  is  not  well  founded.  It  was  not  the  case  where  situation 
with  regard  to  the  fixation  of  valuation  of  the  lis  was  foggy  or 
tangled  and  the  petitioners  were  required  any  clarification.  As 
observed  supra,  not  only  the  valuation  requiring  affixation  of 
maximum  Court  fee  was  determined  by  them  rather  they  on  the 
asking of Court of first instance without objection affixed it on their 
plaint. The study of memorandum of appeal again affirmed that they 
were certain that Court fee of the highest value was to be affixed, but 
they  remained  mum  for  more  than  two  years,  hence  they  were  not 
only negligent, but their conduct was contumacious and there existed 
no reason to extend any indulgence to them to make good the court 
fee  and  that  too  beyond  the  period  of  limitation.    The  appeal 
remained  pending  for  more  than  two  years  and  ten  months  but 
despite  the  fact  that  learned  lower  Appellate  Court  time  and  again 
required  the  court  fee,  but  the  deficiency  was  not  made  good.  The 
provision of section 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 cannot 
be  extended  for  relaxation  of  limitation  beyond  the  prescribed 
period. Reliance is placed on Mrs. Safia Siddiq Vs. Haji Fazal-ur-
Rehman 
  and  2  others  (2009  CLC  262)  and  Assistant 
Commissioner  and  Land  Acquisition  Collector,  Badin  Vs.  Haji 
Abdul Shakoor and others (1997 SCMR 919). Apart from that, no 
legitimate explanation was provided as to why the petitioners failed 
to affix court fee well within limitation of filing of appeal, therefore, 
learned  Addl.  District  Judge  was  perfect  to  non-suit  them  through 
the impugned order. 
4. 
On  facts,  it  is  also  admitted  by  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioners  that  earlier  Muhammad  Tariq,  petitioner  No.1  had 
instituted a suit for possession through pre-emption (Exh.D1) against 
C.R.No.158016 /2018 
3 
sale  reflected  in  sale  deed  dated  08.07.2007  (Exh.P5)  made  by 
respondent  No.2  in  favour  of  respondent  No.1  and  thereafter  the 
antipodal  stance  of  the  petitioners  that  in  fact  the  property  had 
already been gifted out to them by their father on 13.09.2006 is not 
adequate. Had there been a valid gift, then they would have assailed 
the sale while basing their claim on the gift allegedly made prior to 
earlier transaction, but while filing a suit for the exercise of right of 
substitution,  petitioner  No.1  acknowledged  the  transaction  of  sale 
while disregarding their alleged gift, hence judgment as well as order 
of  Courts  below  are  neither  perverse  nor  infirm,  which  do  not  call 
interference  by  this  Court  in  the  exercise  of  revisional  jurisdiction. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  also  remained  abortive  to 
pinpoint any illegality or irregularity in the impugned judgment and 
order.  Consequently,  instant  Civil  Revision  being  devoid  of  any 
merit is hereby dismissed in limine.
