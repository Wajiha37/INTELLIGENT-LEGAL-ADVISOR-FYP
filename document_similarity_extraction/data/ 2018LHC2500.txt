Shahid Karim, J:-  This  petition  under  Article  199 
of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, 
1973  seeks  a  declaration  that  the  notices  dated 
18.10.2017 and 19.01.2018 (impugned notices) issued 
under Section 177 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
(Ordinance,  2001)  are  ultra  vires  and  without  lawful 
authority.  By the impugned notices, the petitioner has 
been required to produce record/ documents/ books of 
accounts  and  has  been  informed  that  the  case  of  the 
petitioner  for  the  tax  year  2012  has  been  selected  for 
audit under Section 177 of the Ordinance, 2001. 
2. 
The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argues 
that  the  petitioner  files  its  statement  under  Section 
115(4)  of  the  Ordinance,  2001  as  an  importer, 
manufacturer  and  exporter  of  footwear  and  is  covered 
by  presumptive  tax  regime  under  Section  154  of  the 
Ordinance,  2001.    In  short,  the  statement  filed  by  the 
W.P No.202214 of 2018 
2 
 
 
petitioner  would  constitute  full  and  final  discharge  of 
its  tax  liability.    In  a  nub,  the  case  of  the  petitioner  is 
that being covered by  the presumptive tax regime and 
entitled  to  filing  a  statement  in  terms  of  115(4)  the 
petitioner  was  neither  required  to  file  a  return  of 
income  under  Section  114  of  the  Ordinance  nor  its 
accounts  could  be  audited  under  the  provisions  of 
section 177. 
3. 
Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
parties,  it  is  apparent  that  the  arguments  raised  by  the 
learned counsel for the petitioner are flawed and do not 
compel  this  Court  to  hold  that  the  impugned  notices 
have been issued without lawful authority.   
4. 
In the first instance, the petitioner relies upon a 
judgment  of  this  Court  reported  as  Messrs  Arshad 
Corporation  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  through  General  Manager 
Finance  Federal  Board  of  Revenue,  Islamabad  and  2 
others 
(2016  PTD  1168)  and 
the 
following 
observations in that judgment: 
income.  It  merely  gives 
“15. 
It  can  be  seen  from  a  reading  of  the 
provision reproduced above that section 120 has its 
genesis in and relates to the filing or failure thereof, 
of  a  return  of 
the 
Commissioner  the  power  to  issue  notice  to  the 
taxpayer  in  case  the  return  of  income  furnished  is 
not  complete.  Obviously,  it  presupposes  that  a 
person is, in law, required to file a return of income 
in  terms  of  section  114.  Section  120  relates  to  the 
filing  of  return  under  section  114  and 
the 
consequences  flowing  therefrom.  The  provisions  of 
section  120  are  not  relatable  to  the  filing  of  the 
statement  under  section  115(4)  of  the  Ordinance 
and thus the invocation of the provisions of section 
120 by the Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue 
was erroneous and ultra vires. It may be pointed out 
that  section  114  of  the  Ordinance  obliges  certain 
persons to furnish a return of income for a tax year. 
The  petitioners  admittedly  are  not  classified  as  the 
persons  included  in  the  ambit  of  section  114. 
W.P No.202214 of 2018

the  powers  of 
Therefore,  the  provisions  of  section  120  cannot  be 
called  in  aid  by  the  respondents  to  declare  the 
statement filed by the petitioners as invalid. Section 
120(4)  of  the  Ordinance  does  not  have  any  nexus 
with  the  provisions  of  section  115(4)  and  it  was 
otiose and unlawful for the Assistant Commissioner 
Inland Revenue to rely upon it in order to base the 
impugned  order.  Likewise, 
the  notice  under 
subsection  (4)  of  section  114  of  the  Ordinance  is 
also  ultra  vires 
the  Assistant 
Commissioner  in  the  case  of  the  petitioners  since 
that  provision  vests  the  Commissioner  with  the 
power to issue notice to require any person to file a 
return  of  income  and  who  has  failed  to  do  so  to 
furnish  a  return  of  income  for  that  year.  The  least 
that  was  required  of  the  respondent-department  to 
issue an order under section 120 as also to issue a 
notice  in  terms  of  section  114(4)  of  the  Ordinance 
was  to  determine  as  a  fact  that  the  liability  of  the 
petitioners  was  not  the  final  liability  and  the 
deduction so made from the proceeds of export was 
not  the  final  tax  in  terms  of  section  115(4)  of  the 
Ordinance.  The  impugned  orders,  the  impugned 
notices  issued  to  the  petitioners  are  without  lawful 
authority and of no legal effect.” 
 
5. 
It  can  be  seen  that  the  issue  in  the  cited 
precedent  did  not  relate  to  a  challenge  to  a  notice  in 
terms  of  section  177  of  the  Ordinance,  2001  and  the 
challenge  in  that  case  was  to  an  order  passed  under 
Section 120(4).  It was under these circumstances that 
it  was  held  that  the  case  of  the  petitioner  was  not 
covered by any of the provisions of section 120 as the 
petitioner was merely filing a statement under Section 
115 and thus the invoking of the provisions of section 
120  was  unlawful.    This  precedent  is  therefore  not 
relevant 
for 
the  purposes  of  determining 
the 
controversy in the instant petition. 
6. 
Next  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 
placed  reliance  on  another  reported  judgment  of  the 
Peshawar High Court viz. Northern bottling Company 
(Pvt.)  Ltd.  Industrial  Estate,  Peshawar  v.  Federation 
W.P No.202214 of 2018 
4 
 
 
of Pakistan (2013 PTD 1552).  In that judgment it was 
held that: 
vide  Finance  Act,  2010 
“…After  substitution  of  section  177  vide  Finance 
Act, 2010 the power to select a case for audit of tax 
affairs  of  any  person  earlier  available  to  the 
Commissioners  were  taken  away  and  now  only  the 
Board is empowered to select any person or class of 
persons  for  audit  of  tax  affairs  through  computer 
ballot.  The  Commissioner  is  only  empowered  to 
conduct  audit  of  the  cases  selected  by  Board 
through  computer  ballot.  It  would  not  be  out  of 
place  to  mention  here  that  after  substitution  of 
section  177 
the 
Commissioners are again misreading the provision 
by  self-assumption  of  jurisdiction  to  select  and 
conduct  cases  of  the  tax  payers  for  audit.  The 
learned  counsel  for  the  department  has  failed  to 
show  that  any  computer  ballot  has  been  conducted 
by  the  FBR.  The  intent  of  the  legislators  to  select 
cases for audit through computer ballot on random 
or  parametric  basis  by  the  FBR  is  very  clear  that 
there  should  be  no  discrimination  or  misuse  of 
power by any tax official. In this background, how it 
can  be  expected  that  the  FBR  would  hold  any 
computer balloting at the back of the taxpayers.” 
 
7. 
It  is  at  once  apparent  from  a  reading  of  the 
portion of the Peshawar High Court judgment that the 
High Court was of the view that power to select a case 
for  audit  of 
income 
tax  affairs  vesting 
in 
the 
Commissioners  was  taken  away  by  the  insertion  of 
section  214-C  in  the  Ordinance,  2001  vide  Finance 
Act,  2010  and  therefore  the  Commissioners  did  not 
have  the  powers  to  conduct  the  audit  on  their  own.  
However,  this  judgment  is  per  incuriam  since  it  was 
rendered  in  early  2013  and  by  Finance  Act,  2013 
explanation  was  added  to  section  214-C  whereby  it 
was  clarified  that  the  powers  of  the  Commissioner 
under  Section  177  were  independent  from  the  powers 
of  the  Board  and  were  not  restricted  in  any  manner.  
This explanation has been upheld by a Division Bench 
of  this  Court  in  The  Federal  Board  of Revenue  etc.  v. 
W.P No.202214 of 2018 
5 
 
 
M/s  Chenone  Stores  Ltd.  (2018  PTD  208)  and  while 
declaring  the  explanation  to  section  214-C  of  the 
Ordinance,  2001  to  be  intra  vires  held  that  the 
Commissioners  had 
the  power  to  conduct  audit 
independent  of  the  Board  and  these  powers  could  not 
be circumscribed by the courts. 
8. 
The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  not 
referred  to  any  provision  including  section  177  which 
prohibits the conduct of audit in the case of an assessee 
like  the  present  petitioner  which  files  a  statement 
under  Section  115  and  not  a  return  of  income  under 
Section  114  of  the  Ordinance,  2001.  Therefore,  any 
challenge  on 
that  basis 
is  without  any 
lawful 
justification and the impugned notices cannot be struck 
down being invalid and illegal. 
9. 
Section  169(3)  and  section  154(4), 
read 
together, makes the statement under sub-section (4) of 
section 115 to be an assessment order.  It recites that: 
“(4)  Any  person  who  is  not  obliged  to  furnish  a  return 
for a tax year because all the person„s income is subject 
to  final  taxation  under  sections  5,  6,  7,  148,  151  and 
152,  sub-section  (3)  of  section  153,  sections  154,  156 
and  156A, sub-section  (3)  of  section 233  or  sub-section 
(3) of section 234A shall furnish to the Commissioner a 
statement  showing  such  particulars  relating  to  the 
person„s  income  for  the  tax  year  in  such  form  and 
verified in such manner as may be prescribed.” 
 
10. 
The  petitioner  agrees  that  it  is  an  exporter  and 
the tax required to be deducted is a final tax under sub-
section  of  section  154  on  the  income  from  which  it 
was deductible.  Thus in the case of the petitioner, sub-
section  (3)  of  section  169  is  triggered  and  upon  filing 
of  the  statement,  assessment  shall  be  treated  to  have 
W.P No.202214 of 2018 
6 
 
 
been  made under section 120 and  shall be  taken to be 
an assessment order for the purposes of the Ordinance.  
Yet,  the  petitioner  considers  itself  immune  from  the 
applicability  of  section  177  and  beyond  its  mischief 
merely on the hypothesis that the tax deductible under 
Section 154 is the final tax on the income. 
11.  However,  this  argument  is  too  fantastic  to  find 
favour  with  this  Court.    To  reiterate,  the  statement  so 
filed  by  the  petitioner  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an 
assessment  order  under  Section  120.    The  tax  being 
final  tax  on  the  income  of  a  person  merely  absolves 
that person of the obligation to file a return of income 
and  no  more.    It  does  not  follow  that  that  person’s 
income  tax  affairs  are  no  more  prone  to  audit 
proceedings.    There  is  no  scope  for  inference  in  this 
regard  and  if  this  were  the  case,  the  legislature  would 
have  created  an  exception  with  specificity.    None  has 
been  provided.    Section  177,  so  far  as  relevant, 
provides that: 
“177. Audit.—1[(1) The Commissioner may call for any 
record  or  documents  including  books  of  accounts 
maintained  under  this  Ordinance  or  any  other  law  for 
the  time  being  in  force  for  conducting  audit  of  the 
income tax affairs of the person and where such record 
or  documents  have  been  kept  on  electronic  data,  the 
person  shall  allow  access  to  the  Commissioner  or  the 
officer  authorized  by  the  Commissioner  for  use  of 
machine and software on which such data is kept and the 
Commissioner  or  the  officer  may  have  access  to  the 
required  information  and  data  and  duly  attested  hard 
copies  of  such  information  or  data  for  the  purpose  of 
investigation  and  proceedings  under  this  Ordinance  in 
respect of such person or any other person” 
 
12. 
The  crucial  words  are  “conducting  audit  of  the 
income  tax  affairs  of  the  person”.    The  term  “person” 
has been defined in section 80 and it is not the case of 
W.P No.202214 of 2018 
7 
 
 
the petitioner that it does not fall within that definition.  
Thus, for audit to be conducted, any person is liable to 
be proceeded against irrespective of whether he files a 
return  under  section  114  or  a  statement  in  terms  of 
section 115. 
9. 
Nevertheless the petitioner will have the benefit 
of  the  observations  made  in  paragraph  23  of  the 
Division  Bench  judgment  in  FBR  v.  Chenone  Stores 
and  only  in  case  the  said  notices  offend  those 
observations and the holding of the Division Bench of 
this  court.    None  was  pointed  out  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioner  during  the  course  of  the 
arguments. 
10. 
In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  petition  is 
without merit and is, therefore, dismissed.  
 
 
 
 
Approved for reporting.
