Precisely, 
the  predecessor 
in 
interest  of 
the 
 
 
 
 
petitioners  namely  Dad  instituted  a  suit  for  declaration  on 
20.09.1999  in  which  he  challenged  the  vires  of  mutation 
No.249 dated 16.04.1999 asserting therein that he was owner of 
the  suit  property  falling  in  Khewat  No.15,  Khatooni  No.148, 
measuring 56 kanals 10 marlas of square No.28, Killa No.4, 7, 
14, 17 and 24 situated in Chak No.650/1-GB, Tehsil Jaranwala, 
District  Faisalabad,  which  was  owned  by  the  Provincial 
Government and in the year 1956 the suit property was allotted 
to  the  predecessor  of  the  petitioners  namely  Dad  under 
“Bedakhal  Muzaraen  Scheme”,  whereas  “Baie-Sletani”  dated 
14.11.1983 was processed and mutation No.132 was sanctioned 
in  the  name  of  the  predecessor  of  the  petitioners.  He  (Dad) 
neither  sold  that  property  to  anyone  else  not  he  affixed  his 
thumb impression on any document, therefore, possession over 
the  suit  property  may  not  be  disturbed.  The  respondents 
contested  the  suit  by  filing  written  statement  on  13.03.2000. 
Out  of  the  divergent  pleadings  of  the  parties,  the  learned  trial 
Court  framed  issues  on  27.07.2001.  Both  the  parties  adduced 
their respective evidence. The learned trial Court, after hearing 
arguments, vide judgment and decree dated 17.02.2010 decreed 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           2 
 
the  suit  in  favour  of  the  petitioners.  The  respondents,  being 
aggrieved, preferred appeal on 24.02.2010, which was accepted 
vide impugned judgment and decree dated 13.04.2011 and suit 
of  the  petitioners  was  dismissed  while  setting  aside  the 
judgment  and  decree  ibid  passed  by  the  learned  trial  Court. 
Therefore, the instant civil revision has been filed. 
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that 
the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  of  the  learned  appellate 
Court  is  against  law  and  facts  of  the  case  as  the  learned  trial 
Court  has  rightly  decided  all  the  issues  in  favour  of  the 
petitioners. Even the learned appellate Court has decided issues 
No.1,  2  &  5  in  favour  of  the  petitioners  but  the  learned 
appellate  Court  has  failed  to  comprehend  that  when  the 
petitioners  instituted  suit  for  declaration  on  20.09.1999,  they 
were  in  possession,  therefore,  there  was  no  need  for  seeking 
possession.  The  petitioners  were  dispossessed  by 
the 
respondents,  upon  which  FIR  bearing  No.478/1999  dated 
24.09.1999 under sections 448/337-H(ii)/148/149/395 PPC was 
registered  at  Police  Station  Lundian  Wala.  Adds  that  prior  to 
this, the respondents Qaim and Muhammad Ali also filed a suit 
on  the  basis  of  oral  agreement  on  28.04.1984,  which  was 
dismissed on 17.01.1979 and appeal against the same was also 
dismissed, copy of which were exhibited as Ex.P12 and Ex.P13, 
but  all  these  documents  were  ignored  by  the  learned  appellate 
Court.  The  other  documents  exhibited  on  record  as  Ex.P14, 
Ex.P17  and  Ex.P1  have  totally  been  ignored  by  the  learned 
appellate  Court  and  basing  his  view  totally  on  surmises  and 
conjectures  has  passed  by  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree, 
thus, the same is not sustainable in the eye of law. In addition to 
this,  it  is  settled  principle  of  law  that  technicalities  should  not 
create  hurdles  in  the  way  of  substantial  justice;  if  a  party 
seeking declaration had failed to claim consequential relief, he 
should not have been non-suited on technical grounds. As such, 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           3 
 
by allowing the civil revision in hand, the impugned judgment 
and decree may be set aside and suit of the petitioners may be 
decreed by restoring the judgment and decree dated 17.02.2010 
passed by the learned trial Court. 
3. 
 
On 
the  contrary, 
learned  counsels 
for 
the 
respondents  have  argued  that suit of  the  petitioners  has  rightly 
been dismissed by the learned appellate Court, because they had 
no  right  to  claim  declaration  in  absence  of  prayer  for 
possession,  as  such  the  suit  was  incompetent.  They  have 
supported the impugned judgment and decree and have prayed 
for  dismissal  of  the  civil  revision  in  hand.  Reliance  has  been 
placed  on  Dilmir  v.  Ghulam  Muhammad  and  2  others  (PLD 
2002 Supreme Court 403) and Ali Muhammad and another v. 
Muhammad Bashir and another (2012 SCMR 930).

Heard. 
The  moot  point  involved  in  this  case  is  whether 
without  claiming  or  praying  consequential  relief,  when 
otherwise  the  plaintiff  succeeds  in  proving  his  claim  for 
declaration, his suit can be decreed or not? When such a point 
came  up  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,  it  was  settled 
through reported judgment Mst. Arshan Bi through Mst. Fatima 
Bi  and  others  v.  Maula  Bakhsh  through  Mst.  Ghulam  Safoor 
and  others  (2003  SCMR  318),  referred  by  learned  appellate 
Court in its impugned judgment but could not conceive its ratio 
in its true perspective, and it was invariably held:- 
‘………………  If  a  party  seeking  declaration  has 
failed  to  claim  consequential  relief,  he  should  not 
have been non-suited on technical grounds. It has 
been  held  time  and  again  by  this  Court  that 
technicalities shall not create hurdles in the way of 
substantial justice. Rules and regulations are made 
to foster the cause of justice and they are not to be 
interpreted to thwart the same. A heavy duty is cast 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           4 
 
upon the Courts to do substantial justice and not to 
deny the same on mere technicalities. Reference in 
this regard is made to the case of Ch. Akbar Ali v. 
Secretary,  Ministry  of  Defence,  Rawalpindi  and 
another  (1991  SCMR  2114)  where  it  was  held  as 
under :- 
“In the exercise to do justice in accordance 
with law the Court and forums of law cannot 
sit  as  mere  spectators  as  if  at  a  high 
pedestal,  only  to  watch  who  out  of  two 
quarreling parties wins. See the judgment of 
this  Court  in  the  case  of  Muhammad  Azam 
v.  Muhammad  Iqbal  and  others  (PLD  1984 
SC 95 at page 132) and Civil Appeal No.789 
of  1990,  decided  on  26-6-1991  (Syed  Phul 
Shah  v.  Muhammad  Hussain  PLD  1991  SC 
1051).  On 
the 
other 
hand 
deep 
understanding  and  keen  observance  of 
proceedings  is  a  sine  qua  non  for  doing 
justice  in  the  Constitutional  set  up  of 
Pakistan.  Those  Rules  of  adversary  system 
based  merely  on  technicalities  not  reaching 
the depth of the matter, are now a luxury of 
the  past.  Neither  of  the  parties  can  be 
permitted to trap an improperly defended or 
an undefended or an unsuspecting adversary 
by means of technicalities when the demand 
of  justice  is  clearly  seen  even  through  a 
perfect trap. It will make no difference if the 
litigant parties are citizens high or low and/ 
or  is  Government  or  a  State  institution  or 
functionary acting as such.” 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           5 
 
Reference  is  also  made  to  the  case  of  Manager, 
Jammu and Kashmir, State Property in Pakistan v. 
Khuda  Yar  and  another  (PLD  1975  SC  678) 
wherein  the  learned  Judge  of  this  Court  held  that 
mere technicalities, unless offering insurmountable 
hurdles,  should  not  be  allowed  to  defeat  the  ends 
of  justice.  The  learned  Judge  further  quoted  the 
following  passage  from  an  earlier  illuminating 
judgment of this Court rendered by Kaikaus, J. in 
Imtiaz Ahmad v. Ghulam Ali (PLD 1963 SC 382):- 
“I  must  confess  that  having  dealt  with 
technicalities for  more than forty years, out 
of which thirty years are at the Bar, I do not 
feel  much  impressed  with  them.  I  think  the 
proper  place  of  procedure  in  any  system  of 
administration of justice is to help and not to 
thwart the grant to the people of their rights. 
All  technicalities  have  to  be  avoided  unless 
it  be  essential  to  comply  with  them  on 
ground of public policy. The English system 
of  administration  of  justice  on  which  our 
own  is  based  may  be  to  certain  extent 
technical  but  we  are  not  to  take  from  that 
system its defect. Any system which by given 
effect  to  the  form  and  not  to  the  substance 
defects substantive rights is defective to that 
extent.  The  ideal  must  always  be  a  system 
that gives to every person what is his.” 
The denial of relief to a party simply on the ground 
that consequential relief was not claimed would, in 
no circumstances, advance the cause of justice. 
 
It  has  been  held  time  and  again  that  the 
natural  result  of  declaration  would  be 
that 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           6 
 
consequential  relief  has  to  be  given  by  the  Court 
even  if  it  is  not  claimed.  The  trial  Court  in  such 
like circumstances may call upon a party to amend 
the  plaint  to  that  extent  and  direct  him  to  pray 
court-fee, if any. Reliance in this respect is placed 
upon  the  case  of  Ahmad  Din  v.  Muhammad  Shafi 
and  others  (PLD  1971  SC  762)  where  it  was 
observed as under:- 
 
“The  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for 
the appellant that the suit could not fail merely by 
reason  of  the  fact  that  the  consequential  relief  by 
way  of  possession  had  not  been  claimed  is  not 
altogether  without  substance.  If  his  suit  was 
otherwise  maintainable  and  he  was  otherwise 
entitled  to  the  relief  it  was  open  to  the  Courts  to 
allow him to amend the plaint by adding a prayer 
for  possession  and  paying  the  appropriate  ad 
valorem  court-fees  and  then  to  grant  him  relief 
even though he had not specifically asked for it.” 
 
Same view was adopted by this Court in Altaf Hussain alias Mushtaq 
Ahmed  v.  Muhammad  Din  and  others  (2010  CLC  1646-
Lahore)  and  Muhammad  Yar  v.  Muhammad  Bukhsh  (2017 
CLC Note 11). 
6. 
 
Facts  and  circumstances of  the present  case  are  at 
par with the above referred judgment, as in the present case the 
petitioners failed to claim consequential relief of possession, so 
the learned appellate Court, when found the petitioners entitled 
to  decree  for  declaration  by  concurring  with  the  findings  of 
learned  trial  Court,  ought  to  have  allowed  them  to  amend  the 
plaint  by  adding  a  prayer  for  possession  and  would  have 
ordered  to  affix  appropriate  court-fee  and  then  to  grant  them 
relief even though they had not specifically asked for the same, 
instead  of  non-suiting  them  on  the  basis  of  technicalities.  As 
C.R.No.1744 of 2011 
 
 
 
 
 
                           7 
 
such, it is observed that the claim of consequential relief in the 
form of possession would be read as part of the plaint. 
7. 
 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  while  placing  reliance 
on  the  judgments  supra,  the  civil  revision  in  hand  is  allowed, 
impugned judgment and decree dated 13.04.2011 passed by the 
learned  appellate  Court  is  set  aside  and  suit  of  the  petitioners 
for  declaration,  alongwith  consequential  relief,  is  decreed  in 
their  favour.    However,  they  are  directed  to  pay  court-fee  of 
Rs.15,000/-, on plaint and memorandum of civil revision, total 
Rs.30,000/-  within  45  days  of  the  announcement  of  order, 
failing  which  their  suit  will  be  deemed  to  be  dismissed.  No 
order as to the costs.
