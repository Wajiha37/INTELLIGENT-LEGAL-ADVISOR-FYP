3. 
The  prosecution  story  unfolded  in  the  crime  report  (Ex.PA/1) 
registered  on  the  complaint  of  Muhammad  Saif  Umar  is  that  on 
01.10.2018 at about 10:00 a.m., he alongwith his father Umar Hayat and 
brothers  Imtiaz  Umar,  Advocate,  Ishfaq  Umar,  Farooq  Umar  and  one 
Muhammad  Asif,  after  offering  Eid-ul-Fitr  prayer  and  meeting  with  the 
people, had come out of the school of their Chak.  They covered a short 
distance when suddenly, accused Bashir Ahmed armed with gun 12-bore, 
Muhammad Yaqoob, pistol, Ghaffar pistol, Tanveer rifle, Noman, Imran, 
Fakhar  Yaqoob  pistols  respectively,  Qaisar  Yaqoob  rifle,  Yasir  Yaqoob 
pistol, Muhammad Mushtaq, Abdul Sattar and Naveed Ahmad armed with 
respective rifles came there.  Bashir Ahmad, Aman Ullah and Muhammad 
Abbas raised Lalkara to teach a lesson to Master Umar Hayat and his sons 
for  opposing  them  whereupon  Noman  made  a  fire  shot  which  landed  at 
the left side of belly, the fire shot of Qaisar Yaqoob hit at the right thigh, 
the fire shot of Naeem at the left arm of Imtiaz Umar, Advocate.  Shabbir 
Ahmad  made  a  fire  shot,  which  landed  at  the  waist,  the  fire  shot  of 
Muhammad Naveed hit at the same place and the fire shot of Muhammad 
Saeed passed on by colliding with the head of deceased Umar Hayat.  The 
complainant  and  his  brothers  tried  to  rescue  their  father  and  brother 
whereupon Abdul Sattar made a fire shot, which landed at the right side of 
belly, the fire shot of Tanveer Ahmad hit at the left elbow and the fire shot 
of Muhammad Yaqoob hit at the left buttock of Ishfaq Umar.   Imranullah 
made a fire shot, which hit at the neck, the fire shot of Abdul Ghaffar hit 
at  the  right  side  of  belly,  the  fire  shot  of  Yasir  Yaqoob  hit  at  the  left 
shoulder and the fire shot of Muhammad Mushtaq hit at the right thigh of 
Farooq Umar.  Tanveer Ahmad made a fire shot, which hit at the ankle of 
right  foot  of  the  complainant.    Muhammad  Saeed  repeated  the  fire  shot, 
which  landed  at  the  neck  of  injured  Muhammad  Asif.    On  the  report  of

firing,  Nazia,  Sadia  and  Rashida  Farhat,  paternal  cousins  of  the 
complainant, came out of the house and rushed to the place of occurrence 
whereupon  Bashir  Ahmad  made  a  fire  shot,  which  landed  at  legs,  waist, 
left finer and arm of Nazia.  Amanullah made a fire shot, which hit at the 
arm  and  waist  of  Sadia.    The  fire  shot  of  Muhammad  Abbas  hit  at  the 
waist  of  Rashida  Farhat.    This  occurrence  was  the  result  of  behind  the 
scene abetment provided by Fazal Karim and Muhammad Awais, who on 
the  day  of  granting  bail,  had  intimidated  the  complainant’s  father  in  the 
presence of the witnesses.  All the accused persons made aerial firing and 
fled  away  from  the  crime  scene.    Muhammad  Abbas  and  Sultan  Ahmad 
came there, attended them and escorted them to the hospital.  Umar Hayat 
and Imtiaz Umar succumbed to the injuries on the way to hospital. 
 
Motive  behind  the  occurrence  was  that  Bashir  Ahmad  had  falsely 
implicated the complainant’s father and a brother, namely Imtiaz Umar in 
the  murder  case  of  Hasnain  son  of  Muhammad  Manzoor.    They  were 
declared  innocent  in  the  said  case.    The  families  of  the  complainant  and 
Bashir Ahmad had longstanding litigation. 
4.  Muhammad  Aslam,  SI  (PW18)  recorded  the  statement  of  the 
complainant  in  the  hospital,  prepared  injury  statements  of  injured  Saif, 
Farooq,  Ishfaq,  Muhammad  Asif,  Mst.  Nazia,  Mst.  Nadia  and  Mst. 
Rashida Farhat.  He also prepared injury statements and inquest reports of 
deceased Umar Hayat and Imtiaz Umar and escorted their dead bodies to 
the  mortuary.    He  recorded  the  statements  of  injured  under  Section  161 
Cr.P.C.  and  proceeded  to  the  place  of  occurrence,  prepared  rough  site 
plan,  secured  blood  stained  earth  from  seven  difference  places  including 
the  place  of  occurrence.    He  secured  seven  crime  empties  of  pistols,  six 
empties  of  rifle  and  two  empties  of  gun  12-bore.   He  arrested appellants 
Tanveer and Muhammad Awais on 03.10.2008.  He took into possession 
the  last  worn  clothes  of  the  injured  ladies  on  09.10.2008.    During 
investigation  Tanveer  Ahmad  led  to  the  recovery  of  rifle.    He  arrested 
appellants  Amanullah,  Muhammad  Yaqoob,  Shahid  Yaqoob  and  Fakhar 
on 31.10.2008 and thereafter he was transferred.

7. 
At the commencement of the trial, the learned trial Court framed  a 
charge  against  the  appellants  and  their  co-accused  Bashir  Ahmad, 
Muhammad  Yaqoob,  Abdul  Sattar,  Amanullah,  Muhammad  Abbas, 
Shahid  Yaqoob,  Fakhar  Yaqoob,  Fazal  Karim  and  Muhammad  Awais  to 
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  
 
Co-accused  Shabbir  Ahmad  and  Saeed  Ahmad  were  at  large  and 
they were proceeded against under Section 512 Cr.P.C.  
8. 
The  prosecution  had  produced  19-witnesses  besides  the  reports  of 
Chemical  Examiner  (Ex.PEE  to  Ex.PLL)  and  the  reports  of  Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PMM & Ex.PNN).  The appellants and their       
co-accused,  in  their  statements  recorded  under  Section  342  Cr.P.C.  had 
denied  and  controverted  all  the  allegations  of  fact  leveled  against  them, 
they  did  not  opt  to  make  statements  under  Section  340(2)  Cr.P.C.  nor 
produce  any  witness  in  their  defence,  however  appellant  Qaisar  Yaqoob 
had examined Riaz Hussain DW-1 in his defence.   
9. 
Learned  trial  Court,  upon  conclusion  of  the  trial  had  acquitted       
co-accused  Bashir  Ahmad,  Muhammad  Yaqoob,  Abdul  Sattar, 
Amanullah,  Muhammad  Abbas,  Shahid  Yaqoob  Fakhar  Yaqoob,  Fazal 
Karim  and  Muhammad  Awais  whereas  convicted  and  sentenced  the 
appellants as stated above, hence the aforementioned criminal appeals as 
well as Murder Reference and the connected criminal revision.  
10.  Learned  counsels  for  the  appellants  have  submitted  in  unison  that 
the  appellants  are  quite  innocent  having  nothing  to  do  with  the  alleged 
occurrence; that the crime report was shown to have been registered with 
promptitude  but  it  was  not  so  as  is  evident  from  the  deposition  of  the 
medical  officer  stating  that  he  conducted  post  mortem  examination  at 
about 3:30 p.m. prior to the registration of case; that one of the deceased 
was  a  practicing  lawyer  and  the  time  had  been  consumed  by  the  local 
police after getting legal consultation of his colleagues; that the statement 
of Muhammad Aslam SI/IO contradicts the deposition of Muhammad Saif 
Umar (PW-1) with regard to the time of registration of the case; that the 
mode  and  manner  of  the  occurrence  as  ascribed  by  the  complainant  by

9 
counting each and every fire shot attributing to each accused one-by-one 
with exact location is    un-usual and beyond imagination; that the injuries 
attributed to appellants Imran, Yasir Yaqoob, Abdul Ghaffar and Mushtaq 
on  the  person  of  injured  Farooq  Umar  were  subsequently  found  pallet 
injuries;  that  the  injury  attributed  to  appellant  Mushtaq  was  found  to  be 
not  involved  in  this  occurrence  during  investigation  twice;  that  the 
question with regard to the injury attributed to the said appellant was  not 
put  to  him  in  his  statement  recorded  under  Section  342  Cr.P.C.  and  as 
such  he  cannot be  held  responsible to that  extent  as  well;  that it  was the 
best  example  of  spreading  the  net  wide  in  order  to  implicate  maximum 
members  of  a  family  in  this  case  of  heinous  offence;  that  four  injured 
witnesses  have  been  withheld  by  the  prosecution,  who  in  fact  were  not 
supporting the prosecution version; that the injured witnesses produced by 
the prosecution could not prove their own injuries, then how could they be 
believed to the extent of injuries caused to other persons; that some of the 
accused persons, having identical role, have already been acquitted of the 
charge  by  disbelieving  the  prosecution  evidence  to  their  extent,  which 
cannot  be  equally  believed  to  the  extent  of  present  appellants;  that  the 
motive  remained  a  shrouded  mystery;  that  the  recovery  of  weapons  of 
offence was inconsequential and the medical evidence lends no support to 
the ocular account; that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the 
charge against the appellants beyond shadow of reasonable doubt and the 
learned  trial  court,  while  passing  the  impugned  judgment  of  the 
appellants’  conviction,  had  erred  in  law  and  facts  of  the  case,  which 
warrants interference by this court.   
11. 
Conversely,  learned  Deputy  Prosecutor  General  appearing  for  the 
State  assisted  by  learned  counsel  for  the  complainant  has  submitted  that 
the matter was promptly reported to the police within the shortest possible 
time,  which  excludes  the  possibility  of  consultation  prior  to  the 
registration  of  case  and  also  rules  out  the  possibility  of  non-presence  of 
the  eye  witnesses  at  the  venue  of  occurrence;  that  it  was  a  day  light 
occurrence  and  there  was  no  question  of  misidentification  of  the

assailants;  that  all  the  eye  witnesses  being  injured  witnesses  had  made 
quite  natural  and  consistent  statements  with  regard  to  the  mode  and 
manner of the occurrence and the specific role of causing fire arm injuries 
by the appellants to both the deceased as well as other injured witnesses; 
that non-production of four injured witnesses is immaterial as it is always 
up to the prosecution to produce the witnesses of its own choice; that there 
was  no  occasion  for  the  eye-witnesses  to falsely  implicate  the  appellants 
while letting off the real culprits; that it was the occasion of Eid and the 
entire  family  of  the  accused  persons  was  in  a  position  to  conspired  the 
occurrence in issue; that the motive part of the occurrence has fully been 
proved rather admitted by the defence in so many words; that the recovery 
of  weapon  of  offence  from  some  of  the  appellants  have  been  found 
wedded with the crime empties and the reports of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency have been received with positive result; that the medical evidence 
lends  full  support  to  the  ocular  account;  that  the  impugned  judgment 
entailing  the  conviction  and  sentence  of  the  appellants  does  not  warrant 
interference by this court.     
12.  We have heard learned counsels for the appellants, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor  General  appearing  for  the  State  assisted  by  learned  counsels 
for the complainant and perused the record with their able assistance.

This  unfortunate  incident  had  taken  place  on  the  occasion  of      
Eid-ul-Fitr on 01.10.2008 at 10:00 a.m., which was reported to the police 
on the same day at 12:00 noon in Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, Yazman 
and  in  consequence  thereof,  the  crime  report  was  chalked  out  at  12:15 
p.m.  The  prosecution  has  made  an  abortive  attempt  to  make  it  a  case  of 
promptitude  F.I.R., which stood contradicted  by  the  complainant  himself 
deposing  that  they  started  journey  travelling  from  Tehsil  Headquarters 
Hospital, Yazman to Bahawalpur Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur at 11:30 
a.m.  and  reached  there  at  12:00  noon  in  Emergency  Ward.  He  further 
deposed that the application for registration of the case was drafted by one 
Sajid  Nasir  in  presence  of  8-10  persons  including  4/5  Advocates. 
Furthermore, Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim (CW-3), who had held autopsy on

the dead bodies of the deceased at 3:00 p.m. had categorically deposed in 
his  cross  examination  that  the  postmortem  examination  was  conducted 
prior  to  the  registration  of  the  F.I.R.  In  such  state  of  affairs,  we  have  a 
reason  to  believe  that  the  F.I.R.  was  lodged  with  due  deliberation, 
fabrication and legal consultation by stopping the daily diary of the police 
station.  
14. 
The  prosecution’s  mainstay  was  on  the  testimony  of  Muhammad 
Saif  Umar  (PW-1/complainant),  Farooq  Umar  (PW-2),  real  son  and 
brother of the deceased Umar Hayat and Imtiaz Umar Advocate and Mst. 
Nadia Parveen (PW-3), paternal cousin of the deceased Imtiaz Umar. The 
complainant  reiterated  the  contents  of  the  crime  report  in  his  deposition 
before  the  learned  trial  Court  deposing  that  on  the  fateful  day  at  10:00 
a.m.  the  appellants  alongwith  eleven  others  having  respective  firearm 
weapons  launched  murderous  assault  upon  the  complainant  party  and 
caused  firearm  injures  to  Umar  Hayat,  Imtiaz  Umar,  Muhammad  Saif 
Umar,  Farooq  Umar,  Ashfaq  Umar,  Muhammad  Asif,  Mst.  Nadia,  Mst. 
Rashida  and  Mst.  Sadia.  Out  of  the  said  injured  witnesses,  Umar  Hayat 
and  Imatiaz  Umar  Advocate succumbed to  the  injuries. The  complainant 
attributed  the  role  of  causing  firearm  injuries  to  each  appellant  in  the 
following manner:-  
i)  Bashir  Ahmad,  Aman  Ullah  and  Muhammad  Abbas  raised 
Lalkara to teach a lesson to Master Umar Hayat and his sons 
for opposing them,  
ii)  Noman made a fire shot, which landed at the left side of belly, 
iii)  the fire shot of Qaisar Yaqoob hit at the right thigh,  
iv) 
the  fire  shot  of  Naeem  at  the  left  arm  of  Imtiaz  Umar, 
Advocate (deceased).   
v)  Shabbir Ahmad made a fire shot, which landed at the waist, 
vi) 
the fire shot of Muhammad Naveed hit at the same place and, 
vii)  the fire shot of Muhammad Saeed passed on by colliding with 
the head of Umar Hayat (deceased).

neck of injured Muhammad Asif (not produced).   
xvii)  Bashir  Ahmad  made  a  fire  shot,  which  landed  at  both  legs,

of Sadia (not produced).

Muhammad Farooq Umar (PW-2) and Mst. Nazia Parveen (PW-3) made 
almost  identical  story  but  the  testimony  of  all  the  aforesaid  material 
witnesses stood contradicted with the medical evidence. The complainant 
had  deposed  that  he  sustained  two  injuries  caused  by  appellant  Tanveer 
Ahmed  at  his  elbow  and  right  ankle  but  as  per  medical  certificate  the 
injury  at  his  left  elbow  was  non-existent  whereas  the  other  injury  at  his 
right  ankle  went  through  and  through  was  an  exit  wound.    Muhammad 
Farooq Umar (PW-2) claimed that he sustained six injuries including two 
exit wounds during the occurrence at the hands of appellants Imranullah, 
Yasir  Yaqoob,  Abdul  Ghaffar  and  Muhammad  Mushtaq  with  their

respective  30-bore pistols but his medico-legal certificate shows that the 
said  injuries  were  caused  through  gun  12-bore  as  the  same  were  pellet 
injuries  with  the  depth  of  1  x  1  cm.    Mst.  Nazia  Parveen  (PW-3)  had 
sustained  four  firearm  injuries  with  blackening  and  burning  around  the 
wounds caused by Bashir Ahmed, who has already been acquitted of the 
charge  by  the  learned  trial  Court.    Likewise,  co-accused  Fakhar  Abbas 
was attributed the role of causing firearm injury with his gun 12-bore at 
the back of Mst. Rashida but her medico-legal certificate shows that the 
same was caused by some blunt weapon.  Appellant Imran was attributed 
the role of causing firearm injury at the neck of Farooq Umar (PW-2) but 
the said injury was non-existent.  
15. 
The  prosecution  had  shown 
the  presence  of  co-accused 
Muhammad  Yaqoob,  Shahid  and  Mukhtiar  Ahmed  equipped  with  lethal 
weapons at the venue of occurrence at the relevant time  but no role was 
assigned to them except their physical presence.  Learned trial Court has 
acquitted nine co-accused having somewhat identical role as attributed to 
the  appellants. In  such scenario, when  more  than 50% of the nominated 
accused  persons  have  already  been  acquitted  of  the  charge  while 
disbelieving  the  prosecution  evidence  including  the  injured  witnesses 
especially having into account the variation in number and nature of the 
injuries being non-existent, the same set of witnesses cannot be believed 
to  the  extent  of  present  appellants  to  maintain  the  conviction  and 
sentence  under  capital  charge.    Co-accused  have  already  been  acquitted 
of the charge and no appeal against their acquittal has been preferred by 
the  complainant  or  the  State,  which  shows  their  satisfaction  over  the 
innocence  of  acquitted  accused.  In  the  circumstances,  their  testimony 
cannot be equally believed to the extent of present appellants.  Reliance 
is placed on cases titled “SHAHBAZ versus The STATE” (2016 SCMR 
1763), “TARIQ versus The STATE and others” (2017 SCMR 1672) and 
“IMTIAZ alias TAJ versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 344).  
A ready reference may be made to the last one wherein it has been held 
as under:-

“The law is settled that if the eye-witnesses have been disbelieved against 
some  accused  persons  attributed  effective  roles  then  the  same  eye-
witnesses  cannot  be  believed  against  another  accused  person  attributed  a 
similar role unless such eye-witness receive independent corroboration qua 
the other accused person-----” 
16.  We have observed that when the injured witnesses remained fail to 
prove the injuries  upon their  own  person,  how  could  they  be  believed to 
the  extent  of  injuries  on  the  person  of  the  deceased  and  other  injured 
witnesses.  Through  the  stamp  of  injuries  on  the  person  of  injured 
witnesses  is  though  sufficient  to  establish  their  presence  at  the  place  of 
occurrence  at  the  relevant  time  yet  their  narration  regarding  number  of 
accused  persons  carrying  specific  firearm  weapons,  firing  of  each 
individual  and  the  injuries  sustained  by  the  injured  witnesses  with  exact 
locale  and  seat  of  injuries,  is  beyond  human  control.    The  person  who 
himself had sustained firearm injuries should have not been in a position 
to  count  each  and  every  independent  injury  caused  by  two  dozen  of 
assailants  at  the  same  time  and  count  each  fire  shot  one  by  one  like 
visualizing the scene in slow-motion because the velocity of bullet cannot 
be calculated with exactitude rather it becomes invisible.  
17.  Another important issue relevant to the discussion is that the locale 
and seat of injuries sustained by the injured witnesses as well as both the 
deceased show that the same had been caused from one direction having 
same  measurement  possibly  caused  by  one  or  two  persons.  Dr.  Bushra 
Tariq (CW-12) conducted medico-legal examination of injured Mst. Nazia 
Bibi,  Mst.  Sadia  and  Mst.  Rashida  and  observed  almost  same  size  of 
injuries with same direction as mentioned in the medico-legal certificates 
of  the  remaining  injured  witnesses,  which  clearly  indicates  that  the 
prosecution  version  qua  role  assigned  to  the  accused  persons  of  causing 
one shot each, is totally vanished.  
18.  We  have  observed  that  the  instant  case  is  the  best  example  of 
spreading  the  net  wide  for  implicating  maximum  male  members  of  the 
opponent’s  families  in  order  to  deter  them  from  pursuing  this  case.

The  appellants’  co-accused,  namely,  Bashir  Ahmed  (since  acquitted) 
alongwith  his  six  real  sons  i.e.  Abdul  Ghaffar,  Shabbir,  Naeem  Ahmed, 
Tanveer  Ahmed,  Abdul  Sattar  and  Saeed  Ahmed  had  been  arrayed  as 
accused.    Likewise,  co-accused  Muhammad  Yaqoob  is  father  of  three 
accused,  namely,  Qaiser  Yaqoob,  Yasir  Yaqoob  and  Fakhar  Yaqoob.       
Co-accused  Aman  Ullah  was  implicated  with  his  two  real  sons,  namely, 
Nomanullah  and  Imranullah  alongwith  two  other  real  brothers  inter-se, 
namely,  Abbas  and  Mushtaq.    All  the  accused  persons  belong  to  two 
families  and  none  of  their  male  members  was  left  rather  a  few  of  them 
were  entangled  in  this  case  by  merely  showing  their  physical  presence 
with firearm weapons playing no overt act during the occurrence. 
19.  We  have  further  observed  that  during  investigation  Muhammad 
Aslam,  S.I.  (PW-7)  reached  at  a  definite  conclusion  with  regard  to  the 
innocence  of  ten  of  the  accused  persons  i.e.  Muhammad  Aslam,  Bashir 
Ahmed,  Yaqoob,  Shahid  Yaqoob,  Abdul  Sattar,  Imranullah,  Fakhar 
Yaqoob,  Yasir  Yaqoob,  Mushtaq  Ahmed  and  Amanullah.  However, 
accused  Abbas,  Abdul  Sattar,  Fazal  Karim  and  Nomanullah  were  found 
available at the spot empty handed.  The complainant had stated the role 
of  each  individual  in  the  crime  report  and  tried  to  spread  the  net  wide, 
which created confusion that who made the fire shot by whom and hitting 
at which part of the body of the deceased or the injured witnesses.  No one 
was in a position with any degree of certainty to bring on record true facts 
of the case.  The prosecution story as put-up before the learned trial Court 
is hardly believable.  Even otherwise, when a single drop of dirt is mixed 
and dissolved in tank of bulk clean water, it makes the whole dirty. In the 
same manner, when some falsehood is mixed with truth, the same makes 
the truth carrying the possibility of falsehood as a whole.   
20. 
Learned  counsels  for  the  appellants  have  focused  that  injured 
Muhammad  Saif  Umar  got  recorded  his  statement  under  Section  161 
Cr.P.C. on 21.10.2008 after twenty days of the alleged occurrence, which 
was nothing but an afterthought story and is not worth reliance.  We have 
observed that though Muhammad Saif Umar had sustained injuries during

16 
the occurrence yet it is nowhere mentioned that he was not in a position to 
make his statement.  Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim (CW-3), who had conducted 
his  medico-legal  examination,  clearly  mentioned  that  he  was  fully 
conscious, oriented with time and place having normal pulse at the time of 
his examination.  The said injured witness remained mum for 20-days and 
got  recorded  his  statement  under  Section  161  Cr.P.C.  before  the  police 
with  considerable  delay,  which  by  itself  renders  his  authenticity  to  be 
legally  not  acceptable  in  view  of  the  dictum  laid  down  in  case  titled 
“MUHAMMAD ASIF versus The STATE” (2017 SCMR 486) wherein it 
has been held as under:- 
“There  is  a  long  line  of  authorities/precedents  of  this  court  and  the  High 
Courts  that  even  one  or  two  days  unexplained  delay  in  recording  the 
statement  of  eye-witnesses  would  be  fatal  and  testimony  of  such  witnesses 
cannot be safely relied upon.”   
21. 
 
Four  of  the  injured  witnesses  having  stamp  of  firearm  injuries  on 
their  persons  sustained  at  the  venue  of  occurrence,  did  not  appear  in 
support  of  prosecution  version  rather  they  were  given  up  by  the 
prosecution  being  unnecessary.    No-doubt,  the  prosecution  is  always  at 
liberty to produce the witness of its own choice but the aforesaid injured 
witnesses  should  have  appeared  before  the  Court,  at  least,  in  order  to 
prove  injuries  on  their  own  person.  The  only  possible  inference  under 
Article 129(g) of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is that had they been 
produced  before  the  learned  trial  Court,  they  would  have  not  supported 
the prosecution version.  
22. 
The motive as set up by the prosecution was that both the deceased 
were falsely involved in a case relating to the murder of one Hasnain son 
of Manzoor wherein they had been declared innocent during investigation. 
Many a questions were put to the eye-witnesses during cross examination 
by  the defence  in this  regard  and  even  the  appellants, in  their statements 
recorded  under  Section  342  Cr.P.C.,  have  not  denied  the  fact  that  the 
parties were indulged in murderous enmity.  Such enmity can be used by 
either  side  and  the  motive  being  double-edged  weapon  may  possibly  be

17 
the  base  of  false  implication  of  entire  male  family  members  of  the 
opponents’ party. 
23. 
The  firearm  weapons  recovered  at  the  instance  of  some  of  the 
appellants were sent to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency for 
its comparison with the crime empties claimed to have been secured from 
the place of occurrence after their arrest.  Though the reports of aforesaid 
office have been received with positive result yet the possibility cannot be 
ruled  out  of  consideration  that  the  same  had  been  managed  and 
maneuvered  by  making  fire  shots  from  the  weapons  recovered  at  the 
instance  of  the  appellants  in  order  to  get  favourable  report  of  Ballistic 
Expert. The recovery of respective firearm weapons, in the circumstances, 
remains  inconsequential.    Anyhow,  the  dispatch  of  crime  empties  to  the 
office  of  Punjab  Forensic  Science  Agency  after  arrest  of  the  appellants 
renders it to be legally unacceptable and, thus, the recovery of weapon of 
offence from the appellant remained inconsequential.   Reliance is placed 
on  case  titled  “NAZEER  AHMED  versus  The  STATE”  (2016  SCMR 
1628) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“the  crime-empty  secured  from  the  place  of  occurrence  was  sent 
to the office of Forensic Science Agency after recovery of the gun 
rendering such recovery to be legally unacceptable----" 
 
24. 
The appellants had mad simple denial in their statements recorded 
under  Section  342  Cr.P.C.  and  did  not  take  any  specific  defence,  which 
need not to be discussed in minute detail.  
25.  Having  looked  into  the  entire  evidence  available  on  record,  we 
have  no  reason  to  disbelieve  that  the  prosecution  has  miserably  failed  to 
bring home the guilt of the appellants to the hilt.  The witnesses of ocular 
account, though had a stamp of injuries on their persons yet they remained 
fail  to  prove  their  truthfulness  during  trial,  which  fact  is  sufficient  to 
discard their testimony to the extent of injuries on the persons of both the 
deceased  as  well  as  other  injured  eye-witnesses.  The  complainant  took 
sufficient time in lodging the crime report after going through the reports 
of postmortem examination as well as medico-legal reports of the injured

witnesses  and  also  after  getting  legal  assistance  from  the  Advocates 
gathered  in  the  hospital  due  to  the  murder  of  their  colleague.  The 
postmortem  examination  was  conducted  prior  to  the  registration  of  case 
and the whole prosecution building was constructed afterwards in order to 
manage the eye-witnesses as well as the prosecution story. It was a case of 
spreading  the  net  wide  on  maximum  male  members  of  their  opponents’ 
families  by  assigning  the  role  of  one  fire  shot  to  each  accused  and  even 
the  role  of  mere  presence  being  equipped  with  firearm  weapons.    The 
locale, size and seat of injuries on the persons of both the deceased as well 
as the injured witnesses itself indicate that the same had been caused by a 
single  person  with  single  firearm  weapon.  The  counting  of  injuries  of 
nineteen accused persons at the same time, when the complainant and the 
injured  witnesses  themselves  had  received  injuries,  was  impossible  and 
beyond  the  imagination  of  human  control.    Nine  of  the  nominated 
accused,  and  some  of  them  had  identical  role  to  that  of  the  appellants, 
have  already  been  acquitted  of  the  charge  by  the  learned  trial  Court  by 
disbelieving the prosecution evidence to their extent whereas the majority 
of  accused persons were  declared  innocent in  consecutive  investigations. 
The medical evidence lends no support to the ocular account.  The motive, 
being double-edged weapons, can be used by either side.  The recovery of 
weapons of offence remained inconsequential.  Last but not least, it is an 
axiomatic  principle  of  criminal  administration  of  justice  that  each  and 
every  case  is  to  be  decided  on  totality  of  impressions  gathered  from  the 
facts and circumstances of the case.  The case in hand is the best example 
of  gathering  such  impressions.  A  reference  may  be  made  to  case  titled 
“NADEEM RAMZAN versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 149) wherein it 
has been held as under:- 
“While  discussing  the  motive  part  of  the  case  the  High  Court  had  observed  that  both  the  eye-
witnesses  had  stated  about  the  alleged  motive  and  they  had  not  been  cross-examined  by  the 
defence  on  that  aspect  of  the  case  and,  thus,  the  alleged  motive  stood  proved.  This  approach 
adopted  by  the  High  Court  has  been  found  by  us  to  be  fallacious  inasmuch  as  it  had  been 
clarified by this Court in the case of S. Mahmood Alam Shah v. The State (PLD 1987 250) that 
the principle that a fact would be deem to be proved if the witness stating such fact had not been 
cross-examined regarding the same was a principle applicable to civil cases and not to criminal 
cases.    It  was  held  that  a  criminal  case  is  to  be  decided  on  the  basis  of  totality  of  impressions

gathered from the circumstances of the case and not on the narrow ground of cross-examination 
or  otherwise  of  a  witness  on  a  particular  fact  stated  by  him.    A  similar  view  had  already  been 
expressed  by  this  Court  in  the  case  of  State  v.  Rab  Nawaz  and  another  (PLD  1974  SC  87) 
wherein  it  had  been  observed  that  a  criminal  case  is  to  be  decided  on  the  basis  of  totality  of 
circumstances and not on the basis of a single element.”  
 
From  the  aforesaid  discussion,  we  have  reached  at  an  irresistible 
conclusion  that  the  prosecution  has  miserably  failed  to  prove  the  charge 
against the appellants beyond shadow of reasonable doubt and the benefit 
of doubt, even slightest, always favours the accused. 
26. 
The  nutshell  of  above  discussion  is  that  all  the  aforementioned 
criminal  appeals  filed  by  appellants  Nomanullah,  Abdul  Ghaffar,  Naeem 
Imran,  Tanveer  Ahmad,  Naveed  Ahmed,  Qaisar  Yaqoob,  Imranullah,
