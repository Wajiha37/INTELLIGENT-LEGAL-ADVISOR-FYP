over the ages, however, is man’s need for another. We were never solitary 
(2) 
creatures, we were and are, social animals – even Adam needed an Eve to 
survive.  This  social  dependency  demanded  that  man  refine  himself  and 
transition into a civilized being. From pairs to familial groups, to clans to 
villages – our species underwent a gradual process of the development of 
civilization. To get meaning across, to understand another, to agree or to 
disagree – communication was vital for a co-existence. The spoken word, 
the  first  languages  which  emerged  were  crucial  milestones  in  human 
evolution.  Language  made  social  interactions  personal  and  profound  – 
man learnt to speak, and to eventually speak their mind. Differences had 
to  arise,  and  differences  had  to  be  settled.  To  resolve  these  differences 
crude  form  of  legal  norms  were  introduced.  Thereafter  through  an 
evolution  they  were  popularized  as  customs  and  traditions  and 
ultimately “law of the land” in modern era.  Social cohesion demanded an 
obedience to these customs and traditions. An idea of a moral standard, 
a  collective  conscience  emerged.  People  in  societies  began  to  seek  social 
acceptance.  Most  of  these  segments  of  our  history,  we  are  still  living  – 
others,  we  are  still  trying  to  revise.  The  modern  term  “Rule  of  Law” 
encapsulates  these  past  ides  –  ideas  which  are  a  basis  of  our  present 
society.  Historically  the  concept  of  obedience  to  ‘rules  and  regulations’ 
was  introduced  through  a  system  which  has  been  derived  from  a  latin 
word  ‘judicium’,  which  was  introduced  in  1623  A.D.  This  system 
ultimately  emerged  as  ‘Anglo  Saxon  System’,  which  is  now  a  glorifying 
Judicial  System  in  various  societies  of  the  Western  Countries.  We  being 
the  Muslims  have  very  strong  heritage  of  discipline  in  all  spheres  of  life 
the application of which is beyond imagination; hence teachings of Islam 
imprint  minute  details  of  the  same  legacy  practically  while  observing 
Islam  in  its  entirety.  Moreover,  we  have  very  strong  heritage  of 
judicature,  as  well.  The  concept  of  accountability  is  ultimate  of  the 
system  introduced  by  the  Allah  (almighty)  through  His  Messengers 
especially  the  last  most  revered  Messenger  ‘Syed-ul-Umbia  Hazrat 
Muhammad    مل س و  هي ل ع  اللهىل ص ’.  Our  history  is  full  of  various  occasions 
when  the  most  celebrated  personalities  paid  respect  to  the  judicial 
system  while  facing  accountability  which  further  paved  honour  to  our 
prestigious system while showing grace being unprecedented.

From the bare perusal of word ‘history’ wherever societal system is 
prevalent ‘rule of law’ has played/attained a pivotal importance to bring 
the society in order being a concept which can refine the society further 
as  a  whole  notwithstanding  the  same  is  applicable  individually  or  in  a 
collective  capacity.  Therefore,  it  has  become  inalienable  dictum  of  any 
civilization  that  wherever  the  ‘supremacy  of  law’  is  breached  the  very 
fiber  of  the  system  has  been  wriggled  down  resulting  into  ‘chaos’  in  the 
society.  Like  any  other  civilized  sovereign  state,  we  are  also  bestowed 
with  Constitution,  which  was  promulgated  in  the  year  1956,  1962  and 
finally  in  1973,  being  a  written  Constitution,  the  ‘trichotomy’  of  the 
power has been defined. Judiciary being one of its vital organs has been 
assigned authority and power to carry on business in the Court to settle 
the rights and obligations in the society to keep it in order as prescribed 
by the “law of land”. As it is human instinct, there is every likelihood that 
certain  people  would  agitate,  exceed  their  limits  and  might  break  law, 
therefore,  society  has  also  introduced  punitive  actions,  which  are 
embodied in Pakistan Penal Code and various other enactments of penal 
consequences. In the evolution of Judicial System it was also sensed that 
there might be some subjects, who can defy the existence of this system 
while  paying  disrespect  to    it  or  may  ridicule  or  scandalize  the  person 
instrumental  to  carry  on  this    system,  hence  to  curb  this  apprehension 
another legislation was introduced  which is called contempt of court.  
It is apathy that the instant case is one of the glaring examples of 
the mindset, which was taken care of by the law-makers much earlier to 
the  incident  in  hand  while  introducing  law  relating  to  “contempt  of 
court”.  The  background  of  this  incident  though  having  no  relevance  to 
describe but in short words it would be advantageous to bring the same 
in  line.  In  the  year  2016,  International  Consortium  of  Investigative 
Journalists (ICIJ)  published  a  report  in  which  it  was  claimed  and  made 
available  to  the  public  11.5  million  secret  documents  regarding  the 
malpractices and corruption of rulers of various countries  and elite class 
which  was  not  disclosed  to  public  at  large,  later  on  known  as 
the Panama  Papers;  wherein  beside  others,  Prime  Minister  of  the  then 
Ruling  Party  (Pakistan  Muslim  League-N)  was  also  charged  with  mighty 
corruption, which was concealed from public whilst being a public office 
holder.  Various  petitions  including  a  reference  were  filed  before  august

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan;  wherein  after  providing  all  legal  and 
(4) 
equitable opportunities a declaration was made under Articles 62(1)(f), 63 
of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  and  as  a 
consequence Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif was declared disqualified to 
be  a  Member  of  the  Majlis-e-Shoora  (Parliament)  while  determining  the 
period  of  disqualification,  it  was  held  that  he  was  barred  from  holding 
public office. 
 2. 
 
Soon  after  pronouncement  of  judgment  by  august  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  qua  disqualification  of  the  then  Prime  Minister  of 
Pakistan – Head of Ruling Party, an untoward incident took place within 
the  premises  of  City  Kasur  on  13.04.2018;  wherein  the  respondents 
being staunch supporters along with number of persons belonging to the 
then  ruling  party,  staged  a  rally  led  by  respondent/local  MNA.  During 
the  course  of  demonstration,  the  respondents  used 
filthy  and 
objectionable  language  in  an  unprecedented  manner  while  uttering 
abuses  against  the  Judges  of  the  Superior  Judiciary,  Armed  Forces  in 
general and Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan and his immediate family, 
in  particular.  This  matter  was  extensively  circulated  through  social 
media with design, with an intent to ridicule the ‘Institution of Judiciary’ 
and  Pakistan  Army  in  the  eyes  of  general  public,  hence,  the  petitioner, 
who  is  President  of  District  Bar  Association,  Kasur  invoked  the 
jurisdiction  of  this  Court  through  filing  Crl.  Org.  No.205769/2018.  The 
matter  was  placed  before  the  Hon’ble  Chief  Justice,  who  while  taking 
cognizance of the same constituted the Full Bench for adjudication there-
upon. 
3. 
 
In  pursuance  of  the  constitution  of  the  Bench,  the  matter 
was  taken  up  on  02.05.2018  and  after  fulfilling  all  the  legal  formalities, 
notices  were  issued  to  the  concerned  quarters  i.e.  Attorney  General  for 
Pakistan.  Advocate  General  Punjab  and  respondents.  District  Police 
Officer  was  directed  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  order  and  produce 
relevant record in the Court. On various dates the matter was taken up 
and  subsequently  after  displaying  the  video  clips  in  Open  Court  and 
keeping in view the report submitted by the District Police Officer, show-
cause  notices  were  issued  against  respondents  No.6  to  11  under  Article 
204 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with

(5) 
Ordinance, 2003 while office was directed to prepare separate files. 
4. 
 
After  initiation  of  proceedings,  Mr.  Shan  Gull,  Additional 
Advocate  General  was  appointed  as  ‘Special  Prosecutor’  and  vide  order 
dated  11.05.2018  charge  was  framed  against  the  respondents  to  which 
they  pleaded  not  guilty  and  claimed  trial.  Prosecution  was  asked  to 
adduce  its  evidence and  list  of  four  witnesses  was  placed  on  record.  On 
29.05.2018 statements of Ghulam Mustafa (PW-1), Zahid Nawaz, District 
Police Officer (PW-2) and Mirza Naseem-ul-Hassan (PW-3) were recorded 
and  they  were  also  cross-examined  by 
learned  counsel 
for  the 
respondents.  Thereafter  on  01.06.2018  statement  of  Abdul  Rehman, 
Correspondent  of  a  private  TV-Channel  was  recorded  as  CW-1  and  he 
was also cross-examined by the prosecution, as well as, learned counsel 
for  the  respondents.  During  the  course  of  proceedings  the  CDs 
containing  video  clips,  as  well  as,  report  of  forensic  with  regard  to 
polygraphist test was brought on record. Subsequently statements of the 
respondents  were  recorded  under  Section  342,  Cr.P.C.  wherein 
respondents  No.9  &  10  admitted  their  guilt  while  other  respondents 
denied  the  prosecution  accusations.  However,  none  of  the  respondents 
opted  to  lead  evidence  in  their  defence.  It  is  pertinent  to  mention  here 
that  respondents  No.9  &  10  had  tendered  unconditional  apology  during 
the  course  of  evidence  while  rest  of  the  respondents  placed  on  record 
unconditional  apology  after  recording  statements  under  Section  342, 
Cr.P.C  and  the  case  was  fixed  for  hearing  of  arguments  by  learned 
counsel for the parties. 
5. 
 
Learned  Special  Prosecutor  while  addressing  the  Court 
submitted  that  the  prosecution  substantiated  its  case  through  reliable, 
trustworthy and confidence inspiring evidence. While elaborating learned 
Prosecutor contended that the prosecution produced three witnesses viz. 
Ghulam Mustafa (PW-1), Zahid Nawaz, District Police Officer (PW-2) and 
Mirza Naseem-ul-Hassan (PW-3), who fully substantiated the prosecution 
version  to  the  effect  that  all  the  respondents  (6  to  11)  on  13.04.2018  at 
4:30  p.m.  in  the  area  of  Shehbaz  Khan  Chowk,  Kasur,  individually  and 
jointly,  in  connivance  with  each  other  had  staged  rally  against  the 
superior  judiciary,  as  well  as,  state  institutions  during  which  they

chanted slogans while uttering objectionable/filthy language against the 
(6) 
Chief  Justice  of  Pakistan,  his  immediate  family,  judges  of  the  superior 
judiciary,  as  well  as,  state 
institutions.  Further  submitted  that 
documentary  evidence  in  the  shape  of  Exh.PW/1/A,  Exh.PW/2/A, 
Exh.PW/2/B,  Exh.PW/2/C,  Exh.PW/3/A  and  Exh.PW/3/B  was  also 
brought  on  record  to  support  the  prosecution  version  and  no  objection 
whatsoever  was  raised  on  behalf  of  the  contemnors  in  this  regard. 
Further  submitted  that  although  Naeem  Safdar/respondent  No.7  and 
Ayyaz  Khan/respondent  No.8  did  not  themselves  chant  slogans  against 
the judiciary, however, they remained present during the demonstration 
of rally. Main crux of arguments of learned Special Prosecutor is that the 
respondents had tried to mobilize the public opinion against the Judges 
of  the  Apex  Court  and  used  inappropriate  language  against  the  Hon’ble 
CJP  and  his  immediate  family,  hence  keeping  in  view  the  evidence 
brought  forth  on  record,  their  act  squarely  falls  within  the  mischief  of 
Article 204 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read 
with  Section  3,  punishable  under  Section  5  of  the  Contempt  of  Court 
Ordinance,  2003.  As  far  as  apologies  submitted  by  the  respondents  are 
concerned, learned Special Prosecutor submitted that keeping in view the 
language used by the contemnors, which is demonstrative of their intent 
in  ridiculing  and  scandalizing  the  superior 
judiciary  and  state 
institutions,  they  in  no  way  deserve  any  allowance  as  such  are  liable  to 
be convicted/punished under the relevant provisions of law. 
6. 
 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
respondents 
vehemently 
controverted  the  assertions  made  by  learned  Special  Prosecutor.  As  far 
respondents  No.9  and  10  are  concerned,  it  was  argued  on  their  behalf 
that both of them have accepted their guilt qua prosecution accusations. 
As  far  as  rest  of  the  respondents  are  concerned,  it  was  argued  that 
although  they  were  present  during  the  course  of  demonstration  of  rally, 
however, they have not been ascribed the role of using filthy language or 
chanting  slogans.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.7  contended  that 
neither respondent No.7 was instrumental in arranging rally or hatching 
any  conspiracy  nor  did  he  raise  a  single  slogan  against  any  person  or 
institution.  It  was  vehemently  argued  that  appearance  of  respondent 
No.7 at the occasion was not pre-planned rather purely accidental and at 
the  most  he  raised  slogans  in  favour  of  his  leadership  only.  Learned

counsel for respondent No.8 submitted that provisions of Section 3 of the 
(7) 
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 begin with word ‘whoever’, hence, no 
person can be saddled with the liability for the act committed by his co-
accused when he himself has not uttered any word. It was further argued 
that  respondent  No.8  has  also  not  been  ascribed  any  role  as  mentioned 
in  the  charge  sheet.  Learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.6  and  11 
contended that both the respondents have utmost respect and regard for 
the  institution  of  judiciary  and  they  cannot  even  think  to  pay  any 
disregard  to  it.  He  further  submitted  that  although  respondents  No.6  & 
11 remained present with the rally, however, they did not use any sort of 
filthy language against the judiciary or any other state institution. It was 
finally  argued  that  in  view  of  evidence  brought  forth  on  record 
respondents No.6, 9, 10 & 11 are not connected with the offence and as 
they  have  tendered  unconditional  apology  wherein  they  have  thrown 
themselves  at  the  mercy  of  the  Court;  therefore,  notices  issued  against 
them are liable to be discharged/withdrawn. 
7. 
 
We  have  considered  the  arguments  advanced  by  learned 
counsel  for  the  parties  and  gone  through  the  record  available  on  file  on 
the touchstone of relevant law on the subject. 
8. 
 
When  the  Court  exercises  its  powers  while  dealing  with 
contempt matters, it does not do so to vindicate the dignity and honour 
of  an  individual  judge  who  is  personally  attacked  or  scandalized,  but  to 
uphold  the  majesty  of  the  ‘Rule  of  Law’  and  of  the  ‘administration  of 
justice’.  The  law  of  contempt  has  been  enacted  to  secure  public  respect 
and  confidence  in  the  judicial  process.  If  such  confidence  is  shaken  or 
broken, the confidence of the common man in the institution of judiciary 
and  democratic  set  up  is  likely  to  be  shaken  which,  if  not  checked,  can 
be destructive for the society itself. No one can be permitted to flout the 
mandate of law of respecting the courts for establishment of ‘Rule of Law’ 
under  the  cloak  of  freedom  of  speech  and  expression  guaranteed  by  the 
Constitution,  which  no  doubt  is  subject  to  ‘reasonable  restrictions’. 
Moreover,  it  must  be  remembered  that  the  maintenance  of  dignity  of 
courts is one of the cardinal principles of rule of law in a democratic set 
up and any criticism of the Judicial institution couched in language that 
apparently  appears  to  be  mere  criticism  but  ultimately  results  in

undermining  the  dignity  of  the  courts  cannot  be  permitted  when  found 
(8) 
having crossed the limits and has to be punished. 
9. 
 
There  is  no  cavil  to  this  proposition  that  the  proceedings  in 
the  contempt  cases  are  ‘quasi-criminal’  in  nature  and  it  is  between  the 
Court and the Contemnor. However, in the instant case this Court while 
extending  its  jurisdiction  provided  full  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the 
respondents  and  all  requisite  legal  formalities  were  obeyed  keeping  in 
view the dictates of Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. 
 
Perusal  of  the  record  available  on  file  clearly  reflects  that  the 
occurrence  of  the  case  in  hand  has  not  been  denied  by  any  of  the 
respondents  rather  it  would  not  be  out  of  context  to  mention  here  that 
almost  all  the  respondents  had  accepted  the  factum  of  staging  of  rally 
which  ultimately  merged  into  demonstration  against  the  ‘Institution  of 
Judiciary’  and  ‘Pakistan  Army’.  There  is  no  second  cavil  to  this 
proposition that the language used by the respondents during the course 
of  demonstration  was  unprecedented  under  the  patronage  of  a  political 
party. Perusal of the record clearly reflects that the same was not staged 
with  a  political  motive  and  design  rather  was  demonstrated  with  an 
intent to humiliate the two institutions of the country viz. ‘Judiciary’ and 
‘Pak Army’, which had been under continuous target of the leadership of 
the afore-said political party led by Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, who 
was  declared  disqualified  by  the  august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  to 
hold any public office. 
10. 
 
The main crux of arguments advanced by one of the learned 
counsel for the respondents is that the  word  ‘whosoever’ in  Section 3 of 
the  Contempt  of  Court  Ordinance,  2003  means  that  this  cannot  be 
extended to ‘in furtherance of common object’. There is no denial to this 
fact that the provisions of Section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 
2003, commence with word ‘whosoever’ but it does not mean that if the 
same  act  is  being  repeated  by  others  and  given  full  concurrence  at  the 
same  moment  it  would  absolve  their  responsibility  qua  accusations 
which  clearly  fall  within  the  ambit  of  Article  204  of  the  Constitution  of 
Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  and  Section  5  of  the  Contempt  of 
Court  Ordinance,  2003.  The  video  displayed  in  the  ‘Open  Court’  clearly

reflects  that  the  slogans  were  equally  responded  by  the  number  of 
(9) 
persons who were present over there in the same tone and gravity which 
was  used  by  the  individuals  who  chanted  such  slogans  hence  they  are 
equally  saddled  with  the  responsibility  of  committing  contempt  being  in 
league and as such the arguments of the learned counsel on this score is 
of without any legal force. 
11. 
 
As  far  as  record  which  has  been  placed  before  us  by  Zahid 
Nawaz,  District  Police  Officer,  Kasur  (PW-2)  as  Ehx.PW-2/A  relating  to 
video  clips  and  report  of  the  photogramatic  test  of  the  Punjab  Forensic 
Science  Agency  is  concerned,  the  same  itself  is  sufficient  to  bring  the 
charge  coupled  with  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  the  respondents  have 
admitted  the  incident  and  as  such  when  the  case  of  the  prosecution  is 
not denied, it is established law that the same would be deemed as if that 
was admitted by the defence. This principle of law is equally applicable in 
the instant case.  
12. 
 
As far as case of Naeem Safdar and Ayyaz Khan/respondents 
No.7  and  8  is  concerned,  perusal  of  record  available  on  file  reveals  that 
both of them remained silent spectators and have not participated in the 
demonstration  with  same  attitude,  which  is  visible  in  the  case  of  other 
four  respondents.  This  aspect  of  the  case  is  further  fortified  from  the 
display  of  video  clipping  which  reflects  that  Naeem  Safdar/respondent 
had  participated  for  few  minutes  and  during  his  participation  only 
political  speeches  were  made,  which  he  being  member  of  the  ‘provincial 
assembly’  was  considered  to  be  within  his  legal  framework  and  as  such 
allegation  of  their  being  violent  against  the  institutions  create  doubt  in 
its  authenticity,  hence  case  of  respondents  No.7  &  8  is  squarely 
distinguishable  from  other  especially  when  Zahid  Nawaz,  District  Police 
Officer,  has  also  admitted  that  he  has  not  ascribed  any  role  to  these 
respondents particularly to Ayyaz Khan/respondent No.8.  
In  addition  to  above,  both  respondents  No.7  and  8  have  tendered 
unconditional apology and thrown themselves at the mercy of the Court. 
Therefore,  while  evaluating  the  evidence/material  brought  forth  on 
record,  we  are  convinced 
that  Naeem  Safdar/respondent  No.7 
respondent

and 
Ayyaz

not  connected  with  the  charge  framed  against  them.  Therefore,  both  of 
(10) 
them  are  directed  to  be  acquitted  of  the  charge,  and  notices  issued 
against them by virtue of order dated 09.05.2018 are discharged. 
13. 
 
As  far  as  case  of  Sh.  Waseem  Akhtar,  Nasir  Khan,  Jamil 
Ahmed  Khan  and  Ahmed  Latif/respondents  No.6,  9,  10  &  11  is 
concerned  we  are  mindful  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  is  to  be 
exercised  with  meticulous  care  when  the  case  is  clear  and  beyond 
reasonable  doubt.  There  is  no  cavil  to  this  proposition  that  respondents 
No.9 & 10 have admitted their guilt as contained in the charge sheet. As 
far as Sh. Waseem Akhtar and Ahmed Latif/respondents No.10 & 11 are 
concerned,  bare  perusal  of  the  record  available  on  file  reflects  that  both 
of them remained present from the very beginning till the end of the rally. 
Respondent  No.6  was  sitting  M.N.A.  of  the  ruling  party  at  the  relevant 
time and he was not only instrumental in staging the rally rather he also 
led the same. He actively responded to the slogans in the same tone and 
gravity  as  raised  by  co-contemnors.  As  far  as  Ahmed  Latif/respondent 
No.11 is concerned he  is stated to be lawyer by profession. Although he 
was  not  an  office  bearer  of  any  political  party  at  the  relevant  time, 
however,  except  his  political  status,  his  role  is  at  par  with  Sh.  Waseem 
Akhtar/respondent No.6. He remained present all the time from the very 
beginning  till  end  of  the  rally.  From  the  video  clips  it  can  easily  be 
established  that  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  he  was  aware  of  the 
consequences  of  the  language  used  by  the  participants/slogans  raised 
during  the  proceedings  of  rally,  which  were  fully  responded  by  him,  he 
actively  participated  in  the  occasion.  The  person  having  such  a 
literary/professional background cannot take the premium as compared 
to  that  of  an  ordinary/illiterate  villager.  There  is  no  cavil  to  this 
proposition  that  Bench  and  Bar  are  two  pillars  of  one  organ.  If  the 
professional  lawyers  would  join  the  political  rallies  staged  to  humiliate 
the  ‘judiciary’  and  respond  the  filthy/objectionable  slogans,  who  will 
come  forward  for  maintenance  of  dignity  of  courts,  which  is  one  of  the 
cardinal principles of rule of law in a democratic set up.  
14. 
 
From  the  above  it  is  fully  established  that  the  act  of 
respondents No.6, 9, 10 & 11 at the occasion was squarely prejudicial to 
the  integrity  and  independence  of  judiciary  of  Pakistan  as  a  whole  as

they  had  attempted to  defame  it  in  order  to  bring  it  into  ridicule.  As  far 
(11) 
as  gravity  of  the  incident  and  the  sentence  provided  in  the  statute  is 
concerned,  we  are  of  the  considered  view  that  the  respondents  have 
exceeded  their  limits  of  decency,  respect,  honour  and  had  made  an 
attempt to disregard the institutions of ‘judiciary’ and ‘army’ and as such 
they  have  not  only  committed  the  crime  relating  to  the  contempt  rather 
they  have  gone  beyond  socially  and  legally  acceptable  conduct  and  they 
tried  to  destroy  the  fiber  of  public  order  and  as  such  this  might  be  an 
attempt  to  create  ‘chaos’  in  the  country  which  is  already  facing  turmoil 
on so many other issues, which are of vital nature and require emergent 
redressal.  Therefore,  while  taking  into  consideration  the  provisions  of 
Section  18  of  the  Contempt  of  Court  Ordinance,  2003,  we  are  fully 
satisfied  that  contempt  committed  by  Sh.  Waseem  Akhtar/respondent 
No.6,  Nasir  Khan/respondent  No.9,  Jamil  Ahmed  Khan/respondent 
No.10 and Ahmed Latif/respondent No.11 is squarely detrimental to the 
administration of justice in addition to bringing the superior judiciary in 
disrespect  and  ridicule.  The  well-known  proposition  of  law  is  that  it 
punishes the archer as soon as the arrow is shot no matter if it misses or 
hits  the  target.  Hence,  respondents  No.6,  9,  10  &  11,  are  liable  to  be 
convicted  under  Article  204(2)  of  the  Constitution  of Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 3 punishable under Section 5(i) of the 
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003. 
15. 
 
As far as quantum of sentence is concerned, as respondents 
No.6,  9,  10  &  11  have  tendered  unconditional  apology,  therefore  we  are 
convinced to hold that they are entitled to some allowance with regard to 
infliction  of  sentence  on  account  of  their  unqualified/unconditional 
apology.  Therefore,  Sh.  Waseem  Akhtar/respondent  No.6  (respondent  in 
Crl. Org. No.211294-W/2018), Nasir Khan/respondent No.9 (respondent 
in  Crl.  Org.  No.211295-W/2017),  Jamil  Ahmed  Khan/respondent  No.10 
(respondent 
in  Crl.  Org.  No.211298-W/2018) 
and  Ahmed 
Latif/respondent No.11 (respondent in Crl. Org. No.211299-W/2018), are 
held guilty under Article 204(2) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 3 punishable under Section 5(i) of the 
Contempt  of  Court  Ordinance,  2003,  and  all  of  them  are  sentenced  to 
undergo S.I. for one month each with fine of Rs.1,00,000/-  each and in
