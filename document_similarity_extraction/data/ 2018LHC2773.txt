Through  this  petition,  Muhammad  Rafaqat  Yousaf 
petitioner has  sought  pre-arrest bail  in  case  FIR No.566/2018 
dated  15.05.2018,  registered  for  offence  under  Section  489-F 
of  Pakistan  Penal  Code,  1860  at  Police  Station  Islampura, 
District Lahore.  
2. 
Succinctly,  the  allegation  against  the  petitioner  is  that 
he issued a cheque valuing Rs.37,00,000/- to the complainant 
which,  on  presentation,  was  dishonoured  due  to  paucity  of 
funds.  
3. 
Heard. Record perused.  
4. 
The  learned  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of  the 
complainant  does  not  contest  the  argument  furnished  by 
learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  to  the  effect  that  out  of  the 
amount  of  Rs.37,00,000/-,  subject  matter  of  the  cheque  in 
issue, the complainant has already received Rs.10,00,000/- on 
29.12.2017  which 
transpires 
that 
after 
29.12.2017 
Rs.37,00,000/-  were  not  the  financial  obligation  of  the 
petitioner but even then the complainant presented the cheque 
amounting  to  Rs.37,00,000/-  for  encashment  to  the  bank 
concerned  which  stands  returned  on  27.03.2018.  In  the 
Crl. Misc. No.240126-B/2018 
- 2 - 
abovementioned  circumstances,  if  the  petitioner  has  not  paid 
the  remaining  amount  to  the  complainant,  he  is  having  the 
remedy to file a suit against the petitioner for recovery of that 
amount.  After  the  admitted  partial  payment  out  of  the  total 
amount,  mentioned  in  the  subject  cheque,  the  complainant 
should not have presented the same for encashment but he did 
so  which  prima-facie,  reflects  mala  fide  on  his  part.  The 
petitioner  has  already  joined  the  investigation  while  offence 
alleged  does  not  fall  within  the  prohibitory  clause  of  Section 
497  of  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1898.  For  all  mentioned 
above,  sending  him  behind  the  bars  is  neither  likely  to  serve 
any useful purpose nor seems justified. Hence, this petition is 
allowed  and  the  ad-interim  pre-arrest  bail  already  granted  to 
the petitioner vide order dated 05.10.2018 is hereby confirmed 
subject  to  his  furnishing  fresh  bail  bonds  in  the  sum  of 
Rs.100,000/-,  with  one  surety  in  the  like  amount,  to  the 
satisfaction of the learned trial Court.
