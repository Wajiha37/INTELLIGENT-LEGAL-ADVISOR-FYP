3. 
 
We  have  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at 
length and gone through the record appended with this appeal 
as well as writ petition.  
4. 
 
The case of the appellant that he was appointed as 
Pro-Vice  Chancellor  vide  order  of  the  Governor/Chancellor 
dated  9.5.2017  in  accordance  with  section  15-A  of  the 
University  of  Agriculture  Faisalabad  Act,  1973  (hereinafter 
referred  to  be  “the  Act”)  being  one  of  the  three  senior  most 
Professors of the University and the condition “for a period of 
03  years  or  till  the  date  of  his  superannuation  whichever  is 
earlier”  is  against  the  law.  The  writ  petition  was  filed  on 
5.6.2018  whereas  his  date  of  superannuation  was  14.6.2018 
and on superannuation he has been retired from the service.  
5. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant argues that the 
condition imposed through notification issued by the Governor 
against  Section  15-A  of  the  Act  ibid  is  nullity  in  the  eye  of 
law.  States  that  it  was  a  tenure  post.  Relies  upon  “Nazir  ul 
Hasan  and  2  others  versus  Syed  Anwar  Iqbal  and  others” 
(2014 SCMR 1827), “Begum Nusrat Ali Gonda v. Federation 
of  Pakistan  and  others”  (PLD  2013  Supreme  Court  829), 
“Professor  Alaud  Din  Akihtar,  Chairman  Punjab  Textbook 
Board  versus  Government  of  the  Punjab  through  the  Chief 
Secretary,  Punjab,  Lahore  and  another”  (PLD  1979  Lahore 
324)  and  “Waris  Ali  and  5  others  versus  The  State”  (2017 
SCMR 1572). Prays for setting aside the order passed by the 
ICA.NO.223243-2018 
 
 
3 
learned Single Judge and that it be declared that the appellant 
is entitled to be reinstated and to work as Pro-Vice Chancellor 
for three years from the date of his appointment.  
6. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the 
University/respondents  Nos.  3  to  5  argues  that  the  order  was 
passed  on  9.5.2017  and  appellant  is  the  beneficiary  of  the 
order  impugned  through  the  writ  petition  and  the  acceptance 
of  the  post  of  Pro-Vice  Chancellor  through  the  same  order  is 
an  acquiescence  of  the  appellant  now  the  part  of  the  said 
order. While referring Section 41 of the Act states that the age 
of retirement has been provided in this section. Admittedly for 
a  Professor  or  Pro-Vice  Chancellor  age  of  60  years  is 
mentioned  in  sub  section  (ii)  of  section  41  and  it  is  also  an 
admitted  fact  that  after  attaining  the  age  of  60  years  he  has 
been retired. Argues that if sections 15-A and 41 of the Act do 
not reconcile with each other then later provision will prevail. 
While relying upon “Mst. Sakina Bibi versus Crescent Textile 
Mills  Ltd.  And  others”  (PLD  1984  Supreme  Court  241) 
further states that section 41 of the Act does not contain a non-
estentate  clause.  States  that  conduct  of  appellant  is  also 
important when he sent a summary to the Chancellor with the 
name  of  three  most  senior  Pro-Vice  Chancellor  on  14.6.2018 
for nomination as Pro-Vice Chancellor. Further that he has not 
stated even in the writ petition that he accepted the impugned 
notification  under  protest  though  in  the  ICA  he  has  pleaded 
ICA.NO.223243-2018

otherwise.  With  regard  to  estoppal  relies  upon  “Combind 
Investment  (Pvt)  Ltd.  Versus  Wali  Bhai  and  others”  (PLD 
2016  Supreme  Court  730)  and  on  the  point  of  laches  relies 
upon “Civil Aviation Authority through Director General and 
3  others  versus  Mir  Zulfiqar  Ali  and  another”  (PLD  2016 
SCMR  183),  “Badar  Munir  versus  Federation  of  Pakistan 
through Secretary Finance Ministry of Finance and 2 others” 
(2015  PLC  SC  1528)  and  “Ghulam  Aulia  versus  Federation 
of  Pakistan  through  Secretary  and  2  others”  (2015  PLC  SC 
1149). With regard to tenure post relies upon “Pakistan versus 
Fazal Rahman Khundkar and another” (PLD 1959 Supreme 
Court  82)  and  “Dr.  Abdul  Rahman  Chaudhry,  Chairman, 
Punjab Textbook Board, Lahore versus Government of Punjab 
through  Chief  Secretary,  Civil  Secretariat,  Lahore  and 
another”  (1998  PLC  SC  419).  Prays  for  dismissal  of  the 
appeal.  
7. 
 
Learned  Additional  Advocate  General  states  that 
an  expired  letter  has  been  challenged  which  cannot  be 
challenged.  
8. 
 
Section  15-A  of  the  Act,  ibid,  is  reproduced  as 
under:- 
“(1).  The  Chancellor  shall  nominate  the  Pro-
Vice Chancellor of the University, from amongst 
three senior most Professors of the University, for 
a term of three years.  
(2).  The  Pro-Vice  Chancellor  shall  perform 
such  functions  as  may  be  assigned  to  him  under 
this Act, Statutes or Regulations.  
ICA.NO.223243-2018 
 
 
5 
(3).  The Syndicate or the Vice Chancellor may 
assign  any  other  functions  to  the  Pro-Vice 
Chancellor in addition to his duties as Professor.” 
 
When we minutely scrutinize Section 15-A of the Act, which 
postulates 
that 
the  nomination  of  Pro-Vice  Chancellor 
amongst  the  three  senior  most  Professors.  Therefore, it  is not 
appointment against a tenure post as claimed by the appellant. 
When  confronted  with  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant 
whether  the  appellant  will  remain  a  professor  as  per  his 
version  till  the  expiry  of  three  years  from  the  date  of  his 
nomination as Pro Vice Chancellor even if he was retired after 
attaining  the  age  of  superannuation,  the  answer  was  not  in 
clear  words  but  was  that  he  can  remain  a  professor.  We  are 
further fortified in our view through sub-section (3) of section 
15-A  of  the  Act,  which  is  reproduced  above.  It  is  clear  now 
that  a  Professor  who  is  nominated  as  Pro-Vice  Chancellor 
remains a Professor and his appointment as Professor does not 
vanish upon nomination as Pro-Vice Chancellor as it has been 
stated in the above sub section that the Syndicate or the Vice 
Chancellor  may  assign  any  other  functions  to  the  Pro-Vice 
Chancellor  in  addition  to  his  duties  as  Professor.  This 
nomination  is  at  the  most  for  additional  duties  only  and 
similarly  when  a  Professor  who  is  nominated  as  Pro-Vice 
Chancellor  is  no  more  a  Professor  on  superannuation  is  also 
no more a Pro-Vice Chancellor. We are clear in our mind that 
it is a nomination and not an appointment upon a tenure post, 
ICA.NO.223243-2018

therefore,  the  stance  of  the  appellant  is  absolutely  worthless. 
Further  the legal hurdles  are  also  in his way  that  he  accepted 
the  impugned  notification  issued  by  the  Chancellor  and 
enjoyed the nomination as Pro Vice Chancellor for a period of 
about  one  year  and  thereafter  the  condition  mentioned  in  the 
notification has been challenged by the appellant without any 
prior  protest  or  objection  by  the  appellant.  The  principle  of 
laches is  also  in the way  of  the  appellant.  In  this  view  of  the 
matter,  the  case  law  referred  to  by  learned  counsel  for  the 
appellant  is  not  applicable  to  the  facts  of  this  case.  Even 
otherwise  on  the  point  that  if  there  is  any  contradiction 
between the two provisions of the Statute the later will prevail 
i.e.  Section  41  and  not  Section  15-A.  In  the  light  of  “Mst. 
Sakina  Bibi  versus  Crescent  Textile  Mills  Ltd.  And  others” 
(PLD 1984 Supreme Court 241) even in our view there is no 
contradiction between the two  provisions of law. Resultantly, 
for what has been above, no case for interference is made out, 
therefore, this ICA stands dismissed.
