JUDGMENT 
 
 
MUZAMIL  AKHTAR  SHABIR,  J.    Through  this  Regular  First  Appeal 
filed under Section 22 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 (‟FIO‟), read with Order 41 of the Civil Procedure Code, 
1908,  the  appellant  has  called  in  question  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 
11.10.2017 passed by learned Judge Banking Court, Bahawalpur, („court‟), 
whereby  the  recovery  suit  filed  by  the  respondent-Bank  against  the 
appellant was decreed.  
2.  
  
Brief facts of the case are that the respondent-Bank instituted a 
suit bearing No. 348/2007 through attorneys, Syed Abdul Majid Shah and 
Muhammad Iqbal, for recovery of Rs. 1,94,95,823/- against the appellant in 
the court, in which the appellant filed an application for leave to appear and 
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      2 
defend  the  suit  (‟PLA‟),  which  was  dismissed  and  the  suit  filed  by  the 
respondent-Bank was decreed for an amount of Rs. 1,94,95,823/- with cost 
of  suit  and  cost  of  fund.  The  appellant  has  challenged  the  afore-referred 
judgment and decree through this appeal.  
3.  
 
 It  has  been  contended  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the 
judgment and decree passed by the court suffers from misreading and non-
reading  of  the  relevant  record  and  the  trial  court  had  not  exercised  its 
judicious  mind  while  dismissing  the  application  for  leave  to  appear  and 
defend the suit, wherein substantial questions of fact and law are raised and 
consequently  erroneously  decreed  the  suit  as  prayed  for.  Besides,  the  suit 
has not been filed by the properly authorized persons and the same was not 
proceed able under the law.  
4.  
 
 On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent-Bank 
fully  supports  the  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the  court  and  prays  for 
dismissal of the instant appeal.

 Heard. Record perused. 
The  appellant  availed  two  Finance  Facilities  from  the 
respondent-Bank by way of Cash Finance of Rs. 50,00,000/- and Demand 
Finance of Rs. 1,40,00,000/- but could not repay the same as per terms of 
agreement.  The  respondent-Bank  on  08.11.2007  instituted  a  recovery  suit 
for an amount of Rs. 1,94,95,823/- through its attorneys Syed Abdul Majid 
Shah and Muhammad Iqbal claiming therein that the appellant had availed 
Cash Finance Facility of rupees 5 million and Demand Finance Facility of 
rupees 14 million on the basis of mark up, against which the appellant had

                      3 
executed  sufficient  securities  to  liquidate  their  liabilities.  However,  it  is 
claimed that the appellant defaulted in payment  of the outstanding Finance 
Facilities and consequently an amount of Rs. 1,94,95,823/- was stated to be 
outstanding, the details of which are as under:-

7.  
  
The  first  objection  raised  by  the  appellant  against  the  afore-
referred  suit  is  that  plaint  had  not  been  filed  through  authorized  attorneys, 
however, from the perusal of the record it is seen that Syed Abdul Majid Shah 
and Muhammad Iqbal have been appointed as attorneys of the bank and have 
been  duly  authorized  to  file  recovery  suit.  The  said  power  of  attorneys  are 
available  on 
the  file,  which  are  dated  02.11.1974  and  22.04.1981, 
respectively,  according  to  which  the  said  attorneys  have  been  authorized  to 
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      4 
file  recovery  suit.  It  has  been  contended  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the 
said power of attorneys have been executed on the date prior to the sanction 
of the Finance Facilities to the appellant, therefore, the same could not have 
been used to file recovery suit against the  appellant. From the perusal of the 
above  said  power  of  attorney  it  is  observed  that  the  afore-referred  attorneys 
have been authorized to perform various acts including:- 
 
“9.  
To  commence,  prosecute,  continue  and  defend  all  actions, 
suits or legal proceedings whether civil, criminal or revenue, including 
proceedings  to  procure  or  establish  the  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  of 
any  person  or  firm  or  liquidation  or  winding  up  of  any  company,  to 
compromise  or  refer    to  arbitration  any  claims  or  disputes  either  in 
such  suits  or  proceedings  or  otherwise, 
to  appoint  Solicitors, 
Advocates,  Pleaders,  Vakils  and  other  legal  agents:  to  make  sing, 
verify,  execute,  plaints,  petitions,  Written  Statement,  Memorandum  of 
Appeal,  applications,  tabular  statements,  Vakalatnamas,  Warrants  of 
Authority  or  any  the  papers,  writings  or  documents  expedient  or 
necessary in the opinion of the Attorney to be made, signed, executed, 
verified, presented or filed.  
11.  
To  advance  money  of  the  Bank  on  security  or  otherwise  in 
accordance with the limits sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the 
Bank  or  by  any  authorized  Director,  Managing  Director,  General 
Manager  or  other  authorized  officer  of  the  Bank  or  within  the 
discretionary  powers  authorized  to  the  Attorney  by  the  Board  of 
Directors  or  any  authorized  Director,  Managing  Director  or  General 
Manager  of  the  Bank  on  such  terms  as  to  rate  of  interest,  repayment 
and  security  or  otherwise  as  the  said  Board  or  any  of  the  aforesaid 
persons may sanction or authorize.  
To  do  generally  all  acts,  deeds,  and  things  not  herein 
12.  
specifically mentioned which are necessary or requisite or expedient to 
carry  on  and  manage the  business  of  the  bank  or  which  be  necessary 
or requisite or expedient for the better and more effectively  doing and 
performing  the  several  acts,  deeds  and  things  afore-said  or  incident; 
thereto.”  
II.  For  and  in  the  name  of  the  Bank  to  do,  execute,  transact  and 
perform  alone  and  singly  and  without  joining  any  other  Attorney  or 
Officer of the bank the following acts or any of them, namely- 
(a) In respect of all cheques and bills drawn or endorsed in favour of the 
Bank or otherwise payable to the Bank to endorse  them as payable to 
bankers of the Bank for credit of the Bank‟s Account or Accounts with 
such bankers or for collection. 
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      5 
(b) To discharge such cheques and bills for payment through the banker‟s 
Clearing House or otherwise. 
(c) To confirm endorsements of clients, constituents and customers of the 
Bank or other parties on all cheques, bills, drafts, telegraphic transfers, 
payslips, pay orders, dividend and interest Warrants and vouchers and 
other negotiable or mercantile or other instruments.  
(d) For  and  in  the  name  of  the  Bank  to  certify  that  the  proceeds  of  any 
cheques,  bills,  drafts,  telegraphic  transfers,  payslips,  pay  orders, 
dividend  and  interest  warrants,  vouchers,  negotiable  or  mercantile 
instruments  or  other  instruments  have  been  or  will  be  credited  to  the 
account with the Bank as specified in the certificate, and 
(e) To  endorse  Bills  of  Exchange,  Hundies,  Bills  of  Lading,  Dock  and 
Warehouse  Warrants  and  other  Shipping  Documents,  Railway 
Receipts  and  other  negotiable  or  transferable  instruments  for  the 
purpose of discharging the same.”  
 
  
  
The  said  powers  vested  in  the  attorneys  generally  authorize  the 
attorneys  to  prosecute/file  recovery  suit  and  legal  proceedings  on  behalf  of 
the  Bank  giving  them  very  wide  powers  for  the  said  purpose  and  the  said 
attorneys  have  also been  authorized by  Clause  12  ibid  to  perform  other  acts 
on behalf of the Bank which powers also include the power to file the suit out 
of  which  this  appeal  has  arisen,  therefore,  it  is  observed  that  suit  had  been 
filed by competently constituted attorneys and no defect can be found against 
the same.  
8.  
  
The next question raised by the appellant is that the Bank had not 
complied with provisions of Section 9 (1)(2)(3) of the FIO. It is observed that 
the  statement  of  account  attached  with  the  plaint  are  duly  certified  by 
enforcing the certificate and the same is in terms of Bankers Book Evidence 
Act, 1891, which is reproduced below:- 
“Certified  that  it  is  a  true  copy  of  the  entries  of  the  ledger 
and that these entries are contained in one of the ordinary 
books of the bank and were made in the usual and ordinary 
course of business, and, that the book is still in the custody 
of the bank.”  
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      6 
 
  
Besides  the  afore-referred  statements  provide  in  detail  the  debit 
and credit entries for transaction of the Finance Facilities along with mark-up 
upon  the  same  and  duly  provide  amounts  that  had  been  withdrawn  by  the 
appellant and returned with their exact date and have been duly attested and, 
therefore, there  is  sufficient  compliance of  Section 9  (1)(2)(3) of  the  FIO in 
the plaint and the objection raised by the appellant is devoid of any merit and 
consequently declined.  
9.  
  
In the petition for leave to appear and defend the suit filed by the 
appellant, the availing of Finance Facilities has not been denied rather it has 
been  claimed  that  the  appellant  had  repaid  the  entire  Finance  Facility  and 
nothing was outstanding and due against the appellant, however, the appellant 
has not provided any dates or attached any receipts to show that when the said 
adjustment/repayment of Finance Facility was made, therefore, compliance of 
Section  10  (3)(4)(5)  of  the  FIO  has  not  been  made  by  the  appellant, 
consequently  no  substantial question  of  law  and  fact  was  raised  for leave  to 
appear  to  be  allowed  to  the  appellant  and  the  learned  court  was  justified  in 
dismissing the PLA filed by the respondent.  
10.  
  
As regards the objection raised by the appellant that illegal mark-
up  has  been  charged,  the  said  allegation  has  not  been  substantiated  by 
pointing out any entry in the statement of account, which could be declared as 
not  due  from  the  appellant.  Consequently,  there  is  no  force  in  the  said 
objection and the same is also declined.  
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      7 
11.  
  
As  already  observed  above  as  the  statement  of  accounts 
produced by the Bank have been duly verified in terms of the Bankers Book 
Evidence  Act,  1891  in  which  no  discrepancy  has  been  pointed  out,  besides 
the  Appellant  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the  Finance  Facility  had  been 
adjusted or repaid, consequently presumption of correctness is attached to the 
same and can be taken up as evidence. From the perusal of the  statement of 
accounts  for  Cash  Finance  Facility  it  is  observed  that  an  amount  of  Rs. 
17,10,000/-  was  outstanding  on  account  of  principal.  The  plaintiff  had 
produced statement of markup concerning Cash Finance Facility which found 
consists of three pages and duly certified and it also shows an amount of Rs. 
4,68,199/- i.e., 3,99,237/- + Rs. 68, 962/- outstanding on account of markup. 
The  period  of  mark-up,  as  per  these  documents  relates  to  30.09.2006  to 
02.11.2007  and  thus  not  found  beyond  the  expiry  date.  The  statement  of 
accounts  relating  to  Demand  Finance  Facility  is  also  found  duly  certified  in 
terms of Banker Books Evidence Act, 1891, and it shows outstanding amount 
of Rs.1,32,45,037/- on account of principal and Rs. 20,92,235/- on account of 
mark-up charged up to  02.11.2007. If the afore referred amount for principal 
and  markup  for  cash  finance  facility  and  demand  finance  facility  are  added, 
the  aggregate  amount  would  be  Rs.  Rs.1,75,15,472/-,  the  break  of  which  is 
provided as under: 
Principal Cash Finance Facility. 
Markup Cash Finance Facility 
Principal Demand Finance Facility  Rs.1,32,45,037/- 
Markup Demand Finance Facility  Rs.20,92,235/- 
Total 
Rs.17,10,000/- 
Rs.4,68,200/- 
Rs.1,75,15,472/- 
 
R.F.A. No.113-2017/BWP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      8 
The  objections relating  to the  validity  of statement of  account  are not  found 
valid  or  sustainable  as  no  discrepancy  has  been  pointed  out  in  the  same, 
however,  it  appears  that  while  calculating  the  final  decretal  amount,  the 
learned  Banking  Court  has  made  error  by  treating  the total  of afore  referred 
amounts  as  Rs.  1,94,95,823/-  instead  of  Rs.1,75,15,472/-  actually  due  and 
outstanding  against  the  appellants,  therefore,  we  modify  the  decree  of  the 
Court  from  Rs.1,94,95,823/-  to  Rs.1,75,15,472/-  with  costs  of  suit  and  costs 
of fund.    
12.  
  
In the foregoing terms, this appeal is partially allowed.
