C.R.No.238288 of 2018.  
Maqbool Hussain Awan   Vs.

Proceeding 
Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
Parties’ counsel, where necessary 
28.09.2018 
Ch. Abdul Majeed-III, Advocate.  
Through 
this  civil 
revision 
the 
petitioner  has  challenged  the  order  dated 
22.09.2018  passed  by  the  learned  revisional 
Court 
i.e.  Additional  District 
Judge, 
Faisalabad,  whereby  at 
the 
time  of 
entertaining the revision petition filed by the 
petitioner  request  for  stay  of  proceedings 
before  the  learned  trial  Court  was  turned 
down.  
2. 
 Learned  counsel  argues  that  prayer 
was  that  injunctive  order  be  granted  with 
regard  to  further  alienation  of  suit  property 
and 
interference 
into  the  possession  of 
petitioner  as  well  as  stay  of  proceedings 
before the learned trial court.  
3. 
On  query  of 
the  Court  qua 
maintainability  of  second  revision  against 
the  order  passed  by  the  learned  revisional 
Court  learned  counsel  relies  upon  “ANJUM 
CHEMICAL  STORAGE  (PVT.)  LTD.  versus 
Messrs  CHENAB  LIMITED  NISHATABAD 
and others” (2016 S C M R 177).  
                C.R.No.238288 of 2018.

4. 
I  have  gone  through  the  case  law 
referred  to  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner.  
5. 
Through  the  judgment  referred  supra 
the  Apex Court  has held that along with the 
appeal an application under Order XLI Rule 
5  of  the  CPC  was  filed  before  the  learned 
appellate 
court,  which  was 
refused, 
therefore, it is a “case decided” and revision 
there  against  u/s  115  of  the  CPC  was 
competent.  This  judgment  is  absolutely  not 
applicable to the facts of instant case, as the 
question  involved  in this petition  is  not of a 
“case  decided”,  rather 
the  question 
is 
maintainability  of  second  revision  after  the 
order passed by the learned revisional Court. 
The petitioner filed a revision petition before 
the  learned  revisional  Court  under  section 
115 of the CPC against the acceptance of an 
application  under  Order  IX  Rule  13  of  the 
CPC  moved  by  the  respondents-defendants 
and  along  with 
revision  petition  an 
application  for  stay  of  proceedings  of 
learned  trial  court  as  well  as  grant  of 
injunction  against  the  alienation  of  suit 
property  by  the  respondents  and  injunction 
with 
regard 
to 
interference 
into 
the 
possession  of  petitioner  was  moved,  which 
was  declined,  hence,  this  revision  petition 
u/s  115  of  the  CPC.  I  am  clear  in  my  mind 
that 
second 
revision  petition 
is  not 
competent.  An  order  passed  u/s  115  of  the 
CPC  by  the  revisional  Court  is  not  further 
challengeable  through  a  revision  petition 
                C.R.No.238288 of 2018. 
3 
filed  u/s  115  of  the  CPC  before  this  Court. 
In  these  circumstances,  the  instant  civil 
revision  being  not 
competent 
stands 
dismissed in limine.
