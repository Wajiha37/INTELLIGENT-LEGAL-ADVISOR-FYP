2. 
Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  petitioners  were  serving  in 
Govt. Girls  Elementary  School, Chak  No.4/FW, Tehsil  Chishtian, 
District  Bahwalanagar  (GGES),  where  respondent  No.6  was  the 
Headmistress.  Respondent  No.6,  on  certain  charges,  passed  order 
dated  18.09.2015,  whereby 
services  of  petitioners  were 
surrendered/relieved  from  GGES  and  placed  at  the  disposal  of 
District  Officer  (Education),  Bahawalnagar.  On  the  complaint  of 
teachers/staff  members  of  GGES,  an  inquiry  was  conducted  by 
District Education Officer (SE), Bahawalnagar, who recommended 
that  petitioners  as  well  as  respondent  No.6  be  transferred  from 
GGES,  vide  report  dated  03.10.2015.  Relying  upon  said  report, 
District  Coordination  Officer,  Bahawalnagar  directed  E.D.O. 
(Education)  to  transfer  petitioners  as  well  as  the  Headmistress 
against  the  seats  mentioned  against  their  names,  vide  order  dated 
20.10.2015,  in  compliance  whereof,  Executive  District  Officer, 
(Education),  Bahawalnagar,  approved  the  transfers  of  petitioners 
and respondent No.6, vide order dated 13.11.2015. Through instant 
petition,  petitioners  have  assailed  orders  dated  18.09.2015, 
20.10.2015 and 13.11.2015. 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submit that respondent No.6/ 
Headmistress, Govt. Girls Elementary School, Chak 4/FW, Tehsil 
Chishtian,  is  neither  the  appointing  authority  nor  competent  to 
relieve  /  surrender  the  petitioners.  They  further  submit  that  the 
D.C.O.  /  respondent  No.2  stands  nowhere  in  the  scheme  of  law, 
hence, impugned orders are not sustainable in the eye of law. They 
add  that  petitioners  have  neither  been  served  any  Show  Cause 
Notice  nor  provided  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  to  them, 
which are conditions precedent as provided in Clause (b) of para 4 
(iii)  of  the  Transfer  Policy,  2013.  They  contend  that  transfer  / 
surrender of teachers cannot be made on disciplinary or administrative 
ground  except  coupled  with  inquiry  under  the  Punjab  Employees 
Efficiency,  Discipline  and  Accountability  Act,  2006  (PEEDA). 
They argue that impugned orders are tainted with malice and have 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
4 
been  passed  during  the  ban  on  transfer  of  teaching  staff.  They 
further contend that terms and conditions of service are contained 
in  Sections  3  to  21  of  the  Punjab  Civil  Servants  Act,  1974.  They 
add that “surrender and relieving” do not come within the purview 
of terms and conditions of service of a civil servant, therefore, the 
bar  contained  in  Article  212  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution) does not apply in the 
instant  matter.  In  support  of  their  contentions,  they  have  placed 
reliance  upon  Regional  Commissioner  Income  Tax,  Northern 
Region,  Islamabad  and  another  v.  Syed  Munawar  Ali  and  others 
(2016 SCMR 859).  
4. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officers, assisted by learned 
counsel  for  respondent,  submit  that  petitioners  have  challenged 
their transfer and posting which relates to the terms and conditions 
of service, so, the matter may be agitated before the Punjab Service 
Tribunal, thus, these petitions are not maintainable. They add that 
petitioners  were  creating  problems  in  GGES,  as  a  result  thereof 
they  were  transferred  to  different  secondary  schools  of  Tehsil 
Chishtian  on  administrative  grounds  in  the  interest  of  students  of 
said  school,  by  respondent  No.2  being  competent  authority  to 
transfer  teachers  serving  in  BPS-11  to  BPS-18  within  the  district, 
as  provided  under  Para  12  of  the  Transfer  Policy,  2013.  They 
further submit that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain these 
petitions  in  view  of  the  bar  contained  in  Article  212  of  the 
Constitution. In support of their contentions, they relied upon Iqan 
Ahmed Khurram v. Government of Pakistan and others (PLD 1980 
Supreme  Court  153),  Zahid  Akhtar  v.  Government  of  Punjab 
through  Secretary,  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development, 
Lahore  and  2  others  (PLD  1995  Supreme  Court  530),  Khalid 
Mehmood  Wattoo  v.  Government  of  Punjab  and  others  (1998 
SCMR  2280),  Pervaiz  Aslam  v.  Ilyas  Hussain  Shah  and  another 
(1999  SCMR  784),  Peer  Muhammad  v.  Government  of 
Balochistan through Chief Secretary and others (2007 SCMR 54), 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases

Government  of  Sindh  through  Secretary  Education  and  Literacy 
Department  and  others  v.  Nizakat  Ali  and  others  (2011  SCMR

1981  Karachi  290),  Khalil ur Rehman and others v. Government 
of Pakistan and others (PLD 1981 Karachi 750) and Nisar Ahmad 
v. Government of the Punjab and another (1992 PLC (C.S.) 1020).  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Surrendering/relieving  order  dated  18.09.2015  passed  by 
Headmistress, only provided basis for initiation of an inquiry in the 
matter  and  basing  on  inquiry  report/recommendations,  D.C.O. 
directed  E.D.O. (Education)  to transfer  petitioners  and  respondent 
No.6 and ultimately, E.D.O. (Education), Bahawalnagar passed the 
transfer  order  dated  13-11-2015  transferring  respondent  No.  6  as 
well as petitioners, which is reproduced below for ready reference: 
 
“In compliance with the decision announced / passed on 
20.10.2015  by  the  worthy  District  Coordination  Officer 
Bahawalnagar in Writ Petition No. 7771 of 2015 titled Irshad 
Begum  etc  VS  DCO  whereby  he  is  pleased  to  approve  the 
following transfers of teachers on Administrative Grounds in

DEO  (EE-W)  &  DEO  (SE)  Bahawalnagar  are 
directed to ensure compliance of these orders accordingly 
and  put  up  proposals  of  vigilant  teachers  for  adjustment 
against  the  resultant  vacancies  at  Govt.  Girls  Elementary 
School  4/FW,  Chishtian.  Furthermore,  all 
the  above 
mentioned transferred teachers are strictly WARNED to be 
careful in future.” 
7. 
Perusal  of the impugned  order shows that  matter  in  dispute 
relates to transfer and posting of the petitioners which falls within 
the preview of Section 9 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974. It 
is  now  well-settled  that  Article  212  of  the  Constitution  bars  the 
jurisdiction  of  this  Court  to  entertain  any  matter  which  relates  to 
the  terms  and  conditions  of  services  of  civil  servants.  Since 
petitioners are civil servants and the matter in issue pertains to the 
terms and conditions of their service, as such it is not tenable in the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court owing to the bar contained 
in Article 212 of the Constitution. Reference in this regard can be 
made to Muhammad Sadiq Khokhar v. Engineer-in-Chief Pakistan 
Army,  G.H.Q.  and  another  (1985  SCMR  63),  Rana  Muhammad 
Sarwar  v.  Government  of  Punjab  through  Services,  General 
Administration  and  Information  Department  and  another  (1990 
SCMR 999), Imam Bakhsh and 4 others v. Deputy Commissioner, 
Layyah  and  16  others  (1992  SCMR  365),  Muhammad  Anis  and 
others  v.  Abdul  Haseeb  and  others  (PLD  1994  Supreme  Court 
539),  Miss  Rukhsana  Ijaz  v.  Secretary,  Education,  Punjab  and 
others (1997 SCMR 167), Ayyaz Anjum v. Government of Punjab, 
Housing  and  Physical  Planning  Department  through  Secretary 
and others (1997 SCMR 169), Habib Bank Limited and others v. 
Syed Zia-ul-Hassan Kazmi (1998 SCMR 60), Province of Punjab 
and  another  v.  Ch.  Muhammad  Ashraf  and  another  (2000  PLC 
(C.S.)  118)  and  Government  of  the  Punjab  and  others  v. 
Muhammad  Zafar  Bhatti  and  others  (PLD  2004  Supreme  Court 
317).  This  Court  is  not  supposed  to  entertain  and  adjudicate  such 
dispute due to bar contained under Article 212 of the Constitution, 
and  law  laid  down  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  in  Ali  Azhar 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
7 
Khan  Baloch  and  others  v.  Province  of  Sindh  and  others  (2015 
SCMR 456), the operative part of which is reproduced as under:- 
Article  212  of 
the  Constitution  ousts 
“149.  
the 
jurisdiction of High Courts and civil Courts in respect of the 
matters pertaining to terms and conditions of civil servants. 
In other words, the provisions of Article 212 do not confer a 
concurrent  jurisdiction  to  civil  Courts,  High  Courts  and 
Tribunals. The ouster  contemplated under the said Article 
is  a  Constitutional  command,  and,  therefore,  of  necessity 
restricts the jurisdiction  of  civil  courts and  High Courts on 
the  subject,  which  squarely  falls  within  the  exclusive 
domain of Tribunals.  
150.  
The  High  Court  of  Sindh  has  completely 
overlooked  the  intent  and  spirit  of  the  Constitutional 
provisions  relating  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service, 
while entertaining Civil Suits and constitution petitions filed 
by the civil servants, which  are  explicitly barred by Article 
212.  The  expression  'Terms  and  Conditions'  includes 
transfer,  posting,  absorption,  seniority  and  eligibility  to 
promotion but excludes fitness or otherwise of a person, to 
be appointed to or hold a particular post or to be promoted 
to a higher post or grade as provided under section 4(b) of 
the Sindh Service Tribunals Act, 1973. Surprisingly, it has 
been  ignored  that  it  is,  by  now,  a  settled  principle  of  law 
that the civil and writ jurisdictions would not lie in respect of 
the  suits  or  petitions  filed  with  regard  to  the  terms  and 
conditions  of  Civil  Servants,  and  yet  some  of  the  learned 
Judges of High Court of Sindh have erroneously exercised 
both civil and writ jurisdictions with regard to the terms and 
conditions of civil servants.   
151.  
We,  for  the  aforesaid  reasons,  conclude  that 
the exercise of jurisdiction by way of suit and Constitution 
petition filed by a civil Servant with regard to his terms and 
conditions  of  service  is  violative  of  Articles  175,  212  and 
240 and the law.” 
 
8. 
Learned  counsel  for  petitioners  has  argued  that  impugned 
orders  under  challenge,  having  been  passed  without  lawful 
authority,  are  without  jurisdiction  and  based  on  mala  fide,  but 
despite accepting it legally correct, the bar under Article 212 of the 
Constitution  restricts  this  Court  from  taking  cognizance  of  the 
matter. Reference in this regard can be made to the cases of Khalid 
Mehmood  Wattoo  and  Muzaffar  Hussain  supra.  Even  the  plea  of 
mala fide does not confer upon this Court jurisdiction to act in the 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
8 
matter  as  Service  Tribunal  is  the  appropriate  forum,  having  full 
jurisdiction to interfere in such like matters.  
9. 
The  next  argument  of  learned  counsel  for  petitioners  that 
terms and conditions of a civil servant are defined in Sections 3 to 
21 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 (the Act of 1974), which 
do not include “surrender and relieving”, is misconceived. In terms 
of  Section  9  of  the  Act  of  1974,  every  civil  servant  is  liable  to 
serve  anywhere  within  or  outside  the  province  in  any  post  under 
the  Government  of  the  Punjab  or  the  Federal  Government  or  any 
Provincial  Government  or  a  local  authority  or  a  corporation  or  a 
body  set  up  or  established  by  any  such  Government,  within  the 
contemplation  of  said  provisions  of  law.    Office  order  dated 
18.09.2015,  surrendering/relieving  services  of  the  petitioners,  can 
be considered a recommendation of Headmistress to the competent 
authority  and,  thereafter,  the  competent  authority  transferred  the 
petitioners  for  the  reasons  recorded  in  the  impugned  order. 
Reference  can  be  made  to  judgment  passed  in  the  case  titled 
Pathan v. The State (2015 SCMR 315) wherein Hon’ble Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  observed  that  head  teacher  had  no  authority  to 
transfer  a  teacher  of  his  school  to  another,  but  he  can  only 
recommend  his  transfer  to  the  Education  Officer  of  the  District. 
Initial recommendation of Headmistress stood merged in the final 
order  passed  by  the  competent  authority  and  is  no  more  in  field 
under the doctrine of merger. Reference can be made to Sahabzadi 
Maharunisa  and  another  v.  Mst.  Ghulam  Sughran  and  another 
(PLD 2016 SC 358). Initial or final order, whether illegal, without 
jurisdiction  and  corum  non  judice,  remedy  still  lies  before  the 
Service Tribunal on account of bar contained in Article 212 of the 
Constitution.  Therefore,  office  order  dated  18.09.2015, 
surrendering  /  relieving  services  of  the  petitioners,  cannot  be 
assailed  through  constitutional  petition  under  Article  199  of  the 
Constitution.   
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
9 
10.  Even  otherwise,  statute  exercising  a  right  of  appeal  from 
interim order could not be bypassed by bringing under attack such 
interim  order  in  constitutional  jurisdiction.  Party  effected  thereto 
had  to  wait  till  it  matures  into  final  order  and  then  to  attack  it  in 
proper exclusive form. Under the law, when final order cannot be 
interfered  with  by  this  Court,  interference  qua  interim  order  will 
manifestly  frustrate  the  object  of  law  and  delay  the  disposal  of 
main  case.  Any  forum  or  Court,  which  had  no  jurisdiction  to 
decide  the  main  matter  in  a  case  before  it,  had  no  jurisdiction  to 
decide any ancillary or incidental matter thereto. Reference, in this 
regard, is made to Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi v. Province of Sindh 
through  Chief  Secretary,  S  &  GAD  Karachi  and  another  (1996 
SCMR  1165),  S.M.  Waseem  Ashraf  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan 
through Secretary M/O Housing and Works, Islamabad and others 
(2013  SCMR  338),  Province  of  Punjab  and  another  v.  Ch. 
Muhammad Ashraf and another (2000 PLC (C.S.) 118), Muzaffar 
Hussain  v.  The  Superintendent  of  Police,  District  Sialkot  (2002 
PLC (C.S.) 442) and Osman Khan through Attorney v. Aisha Naz 
and 2 others (2010 CLC 475).  
11.  Undeniably,  the  issue  of  upgradation  did  not  form  part  of 
terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  civil  servants  as  held  by  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Syed  Munawar  Ali  and 
others  supra,  relied  upon  by  the  petitioners,  but  it  has  not  been 
shown  that  the  matter  relating  to  transfer  /  posting  /  placement  / 
repatriation  /  surrender  does  not  come  within  the  ambit  of  terms 
and conditions of service.  
12. 
It  needs  to  be  emphasized  that  even  any  matter  connected 
with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  is  also  barred  under  the 
said provisions of the Constitution. The said ouster clause creates a 
bar  with  regard  to  all  the  matters  falling  within  the  ambit  of 
authority  of  Service  Tribunal.  Even  the  vires  of  the  rules  on  the 
plea  of  alteration  of  terms  and  conditions  of  service  can  be 
challenged  before  the  Service  Tribunal  and  bar  of  Article  212  of 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
10 
the  Constitution  in  such  case  is  applicable  with  full  force. 
Petitioners  cannot  bypass  Service  Tribunal by  adding  a  ground  of 
assailing  rules  or  violation  of  fundamental  rights.  The  Service 
Tribunal  is  competent  to  adjudicate  upon  the  question  of  vires  of 
rules framed by the department, even if the same were challenged 
on the basis of violation of fundamental rights of the civil servant. 
As  in  the  instant  case,  the  Transfer  Policy,  2013  has  been 
challenged in some of the petitions, such rules / notification could 
be termed as an order within the contemplation of the provisions of 
the Punjab Service Tribunals Act, 1974 and could be challenged in 
appeal  before  the  Service  Tribunal.  Reference,  in  this  regard,  is 
made  to  Iqan  Ahmed  Khurram  v.  Government  of  Pakistan  and 
others  (PLD  1980  Supreme  Court  153),  I.  A.  Sharwani  and 
others  v.  Government  of  Pakistan  through  Secretary,  Finance 
Division, Islamabad and others (1991 SCMR 1041), Ms. Anyesha 
Bashir  Wani  and  others  v.  Government  of  Pakistan  and  others 
(2012  PLC  (C.S.)  31),  Muhammad  Asghar  v.  Government  of 
Balochistan  through  Chief  Secretary  Balochistan  and  6  others 
(2012  PLC  (C.S.)  142),  Abdul  Khaliq  v.  Government  of 
Balochistan  through  Chief  Secretary,  Civil  Secretariat  and  3 
others  (2012  PLC  (C.S.)  1211)  and  Engineer  Musharaf  Shah  v. 
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary and 
2 others (2015 PLC (C.S.) 215). 
13. 
In somewhat identical matter, the learned Division Bench of 
this Court in Fazal Ahmad Ranjha and 28 others v. Government of 
the Punjab through Secretary Education (Schools), Lahore and 39 
others  [2016  PLC  (C.S.)  1209],  in  the  matter  of  transfer,  posting 
and placement, has ruled as under:- 
are 
civil 
servants 
Keeping  in  view  the  aforenoted  it  is  held  that 
“15.  
were 
appellants 
through  different 
transferred/posted/placed  as  DTEs 
orders.  Transfer/posting/placement  is  part  of  their  terms 
and  conditions  of  service.  Therefore,  in  case  they  have 
been  sent  back/transferred/posted/ 
they 
cannot assert any right before this court in view of the bar 
repatriated, 
and 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases

contained  in  Article  212  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic  of  Pakistan.  We  are  guided  by  the  dictum  laid 
down  by  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 
judgments  reported  as  Secretary  to  Government  of  the 
Punjab Health Department, Lahore and others Vs Dr.Abida 
Iqbal  and  another  (2009  SCMR  61),  Peer  Muhammad Vs 
Government  of  Balochistan  through  Chief  Secretary  and 
others (2007 SCMR 54), Syed Mazher Hussain Bukhari Vs 
Secretary, Government of Punjab, Local Government and 
Rural Development, Department, Lahore and others (1998 
SCMR  1948),  Asadullah  Rashid  Vs  Haji  Muhammad 
Muneer  and  others  (1998  SCMR  2129)  and  Khalid 
Mahmood  Wattoo  Vs  Government  of  Punjab  and  others  
(1998 SCMR 2280). 
16. Apart from dealing with the question of transfer/posting 
of  a  civil  servant,  the  Honourable  Apex  Court  in  the 
aforenoted  judgments  has  dealt  with  the  question  that 
even  if  an  order  passed  by  a  departmental  authority  qua 
terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  a  civil  servant  is 
malafide,  coram  non 
judice,  ultra  vires  or  without 
jurisdiction,  this  Court  has  no  mandate  to  look  into  or 
decide about the vires of such an order.  
17.  While discussing the bar contained in Article 212 of the 
Constitution,  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 
has  held  in  unequivocal  and  clear  terms  that  the  bar  is 
absolute  in  view  of  the  fact  that  under  the  aforenoted 
Article, respective Service Tribunals have been constituted 
to  adjudicate  upon  and  decide  exclusively  about  the 
matters  and  issues  pertaining  to  terms  and  conditions  of 
service of a civil servants. Therefore, resort to this court by 
invoking  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan cannot be made. The words in which 
Article  212  of  the  Constitution  is  couched,  gives  it  an 
overriding effect over the other Articles qua the terms and 
conditions  of  service,  whereas  the  jurisdiction  exercised 
under  Article  199  being  subject  to  the  Constitution  would 
be ousted insofar as the  terms and  conditions of services 
of  a  civil  servant  are  concerned.  Reliance  can  be  placed 
on the judgments reported as “Ali Azhar Khan Baloch and 
others v. Province of Sindh and others  (2015 SCMR 456) 
and National Assembly Secretariat v. Manzoor Ahmed and 
another (2015 SCMR 253).” 
14.  Needless 
to  observe  here 
that  underlying  object  of 
incorporation of Article 212 in the Constitution and establishment 
of  Service  Tribunal by  legislation  was  to  provide  expeditious  and 
inexpensive  remedy  to  civil  servants  for  redressal  of  their 
grievances arising out of violation of terms and conditions of their 
service. Establishment of Service Tribunal aimed at prevention of 
W. P. No.8708 of 2015/BWP & connected cases 
 
12 
intrusions into or inroad on  terms  and  conditions of  civil  servants 
by  departmental  authorities.  Unlike  constitutional  jurisdiction  of 
this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  confined  to 
question  of  law  without  venturing  upon  resolution  of  factual 
controversies, it was within the jurisdiction of Service Tribunal and 
it was its obligation to decide all questions of law and facts raised 
by  petitioners  in  instant  petitions.  Civil  servants  could  be 
transferred/surrendered/posted/repatriated  during  period  of  service 
anywhere, which would fall under terms and conditions of service 
or matters connected therewith and jurisdiction of this Court, under 
Article  212  of  the  Constitution,  is  explicitly  barred.  Case  of 
petitioners  fall  within  the  ambit  of  Transfer  Policy  which,  for  all 
intents  and  purposes,  forms  part  of  terms  and  conditions  of  their 
service  or  matters  connected  therewith.  Constitutional  petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution by a civil servant in relation 
to  any  matter  connected  with the  terms  and  conditions  of service, 
in  respect  whereof  Service  Tribunal  has  jurisdiction,  is  not 
maintainable  in  view  of  the  provisions  of  Article  212  ibid. 
Reference can be made to case of Pervaiz Aslam supra.   
15. 
 
In  view  of  above,  this  petition  as  well  as  connected 
petitions,  being  not  maintainable,  are  hereby  dismissed  with  no 
order as to costs.
