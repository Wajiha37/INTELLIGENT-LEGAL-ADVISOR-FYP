MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant  petition,  petitioner  has  assailed  judgment  &  decree  dated 
02.12.2015,  passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Lahore, 
whereby  appeal  filed  by  respondent  No.1  against  judgment  & 
decree  dated  01.04.2015,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 
Lahore, was partly accepted and findings of learned trial Court to 
the extent of 22-Tolas gold ornaments were reversed. 
2. 
Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  petitioner  filed  suit  for 
recovery  of  dowry  articles  or  alternate  value  of  Rs.10,00,000/-, 
maintenance  allowance,  dower  amount  and  gold  ornaments 
weighing 42-Tolas. In the earlier round of litigation, learned Judge 
Family  Court  decided  the  suit  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated 
28.10.2013.  Both  the  parties  approached  learned  lower  Appellate 
Court, whereby suit to the extent of Issues No.1 & 4 was remanded 
back  to  learned  trial  Court  for  afresh  decision  with  direction  to 
decide the same in the light of available evidence and record, after 
W. P. No.335 of 2016

affording  further  opportunity  to  respondent  No.1.  Both  the 
aforesaid issues are reproduced hereunder:- 
1. 
4. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover dowry articles as 
per  list  attached  or  in  alternative  Rs.10,00,000/-?  If  so, 
upto what extent? OPP.  
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover gold ornaments 
weighing 42-Tolas as prayed for? OPP. 
 
 
In  post-remand  proceedings,  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 
vide judgment & decree dated 01.04.2015, proceeded to decide the 
above  issues  partly  in  favour  of  petitioner  in  the  manner  that 
petitioner  was  held  entitled  to  recover  22-Tolas  gold  ornaments, 
which were given to her from the side of her in laws, as admitted 
by  respondent  No.1  himself,  whereas  claim  of  petitioner  for 
recovery  of  20-Tolas  gold  ornaments  was  dismissed.  As  regards 
dowry  articles,  petitioner  was  held  entitled  to  recover  the  same 
excluding  the  items  mentioned  at  Sr.  No.2,  4,  10,  14,  16,  18,  20, 
22, 37 to 39, 43, 53, 58 to 85 as per list Exh.P2/A, or their alternate 
value  with  20%  depreciation  upon  each  item.  Feeling  aggrieved, 
respondent  No.1  preferred  appeal  before  learned  lower  Appellate 
Court,  which  was  partly  accepted  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated 
02.12.2015 and findings of learned trial Court to the extent of 22-
Tolas gold ornaments were reversed and those to the extent of 20-
Tolas  gold  ornaments  were  upheld.  Hence,  instant  constitutional 
petition.  
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  submits  that  impugned 
judgment  &  decree,  passed  by  learned  lower  Appellate  Court,  is 
illegal and without any lawful justification. He adds that impugned 
appellate  judgment  &  decree  is  absolutely  non-speaking  and  the 
same  has  been  passed  without  keeping  in  view  the  well-settled 
principle of law enshrined by the Superior Courts that  bridal gifts 
are in addition to Haq Mehr / dower and not in lieu thereof, thus, 
do  not  form  part  of  the  dower.  He  further  submits  that  gold 
W. P. No.335 of 2016 
 
3 
ornaments,  mentioned  at  Sr.  No.16  of  Nikahnama  (Exh.P4),  are 
bridal gifts, which could not be confused with dower and were not 
liable to be returned to respondent No.1 on the ground of Khula. In 
support of his submissions, he has referred to Shakeel Saood Khan 
v. Rizwana Khanum and another (PLD 2012 Lahore 43).  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 defends the 
impugned appellate judgment & decree and submits that petitioner 
has  failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  or  legal  infirmity  in  the 
impugned decision, thus, same is liable to be upheld under the law. 
He  further  argued 
that 
learned  Family  Court  also 
lacked 
jurisdiction  to  entertain  claims  of  the  petitioner  regarding  entries 
made  against  column  No.  16  of  Nikahnama.  In  support  of  his 
contentions, he has placed reliance upon Amir Bibi through Legal 
Heirs  v.  Muhammad  Khurshid  and  others  (2003  SCMR  1261), 
Muhammad Bashir Ali Siddiqui v. Mst. Sarwar Jahan Begum and 
another (2008 SCMR 186), Muhammad Akram v. Mst. Hajra Bibi 
and 2 others (PLD 2007 Lahore 515), Mst. Naveeda Kausar and 
others  v.  Mauzzam  Khan  and  others  (2016  CLC  180)  and  State 
Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan  v.  Qazi  Majid  Ali  and  2 
others (2016 CLC 765).   
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
The issue under dispute calls for a perusal of entries made at 
serial  Nos.13,  14,  15  and  16  of  the  Nikahnama  (Exh.P4)  which 
shows  that  Haqmahr  of  Rs.5000/-  was  fixed  in  the  entry  against 
serial  No.13,  payment  of  which  was  deferred  since  the  entry 
against serial No. 14 has been left empty. The entry against serial 
No.  15  shows  that  no  part  of  Haqmahr  was  paid  at  the  time  of 
marriage. The entry of gold ornaments, weighing 22-Tolas, having 
been given to the bride by family of respondent No. 1 is shown at 
serial No. 16 of the Nikahnama which is reproduced below:- 
W. P. No.335 of 2016

Perusal  of  above  column  shows 
that  22-Tolas  gold 
ornaments were given to the petitioner by family of the respondent 
No.  1  which  became  ownership  of  the  petitioner.  Although  it  is 
written  in  answer to the question if  in  lieu  of dower  any  property 
has been given yet the mention of Rs. 5,000/- as dower in column 
No. 13 leaves no doubt that the gold ornaments are in addition to 
the  Haqmahr  and  not  in  lieu  thereof  and  do  not  form  part  of  the 
dower. Obviously, gold ornaments, weighing 22-Tolas, have much 
greater  value  than  Rs.5000/-  and  could  not  be  treated  as  part  of 
Haqmahr of Rs.5,000/- only. Entries against serial Nos. 13, 14, 15 
and 16 cannot be construed in such a manner so as to conclude that 
the  Haqmahr  consisted  of  Rs.5,000/-  and  gold  ornaments 
mentioned  in  column  No.  16.  The  position  would  have  been 
otherwise if the gold ornaments had also been mentioned at serial 
Nos.13, 14 and 15 of the Nikahnama which is not the case here. It 
follows that such gold ornaments are not part and parcel of dower 
but  have  to  be  regarded  as  bridal  gifts  in  contradistinction  to 
dower. In the given circumstances 22-Tolas gold ornaments being 
bridal gifts cannot be withheld by the husband  in lieu of Khula as 
the said bridal gifts are not part of dower. Reference in this regard 
can  be  made  to  the  case  of  Shakeel  Saood  Khan  (supra).  Even 
otherwise  respondent  No.  1  while  appearing  as  DW1  has  also 
shown  his  consent  to  return  22-Tolas  gold  ornaments  to  the 
petitioner.  
7. 
Section  2(a)  of  Dowry  and  Bridal  Gifts  (Restriction)  Act, 
1976 has defined ‘bridal gift’, ‘dowry’ and ‘present’, which shows 
W. P. No.335 of 2016 
 
5 
that  the  articles  of  ‘dowry’,  ‘bridal  gift’,  ‘presents’  or  all  other 
movable property are the belongings of bride. Bridal gifts given by 
husband are absolute property of wife and cannot be snatched from 
her. Under the  Sharia, the  marriage  between  a  man  and  a  woman 
can  be  dissolved  on  the  basis  of  Khula,  for  which  some 
consideration,  which  is  in  the  form  of  dower  which  the  wife  is 
entitled  to  receive  at  the  time  of  marriage  or  on  demand,  is  to  be 
forgiven. In the present case, only certain amount is mentioned in 
Column No.13 of the Nikahnama as dower money, however, there 
is  no  mention  of  gold  ornaments  therein.  Consideration  for 
marriage  is  dower  amount  which  has  not  been  paid  to  the  wife. 
Petitioner (wife) has waived her dower amount in consideration of 
Khula  which  is  enough.  Learned  Appellate  Court  has  failed  to 
consider  this  aspect  of  the  case,  hence,  impugned  judgment  & 
decree  dated  02.12.2015,  passed  by  learned  Additional  District 
Judge,  Lahore,  is  patently  illegal.  Reference  is  made  to  Tania 
Naseer v. Muhammad Zubair and 2 others (2017 YLR 1481) and 
Mst. Mussarat Iqbal Niazi v. Judge Family Court and others (2013 
CLC 276). 
8. 
So  far  as  the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent No. 1 that Family Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain 
claims regarding entry made against column No. 16 of Nikahnama, 
suffice it to say that Entry No.10 added in the Schedule (Part I) of 
Family  Courts  Act,  1964, 
through  Act  No.11/2015  dated 
18.03.2015 confers jurisdiction upon the Family Court to entertain 
and adjudicate any matter arising out of the Nikahnama. This issue 
was  considered  at  length  by  this  Court  in  Muhammad  Imran  v. 
Additional District Judge, Multan and 3 others (PLD 2018 Lahore 
429)  and  Mst.  Mithan  v.  Additional  District  Judge,  Jatoi  and  7 
others  (2017  MLD  1101),  and  the  objection  qua  jurisdiction  of 
Family Court was repelled.

9. 
In  view  of  the  above,  instant  petition  is  allowed.  The 
impugned  appellate  judgment  &  decree  dated  02.12.2015,  passed 
by  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Lahore  are  set  aside  being 
illegal  and  without  lawful  authority  and  consequently,  judgment 
and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Lahore  is 
restored.
