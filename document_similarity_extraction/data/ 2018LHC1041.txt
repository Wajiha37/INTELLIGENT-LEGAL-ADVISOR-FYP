opinion/advice  from  the  Ministry  of  Information  & 
Technology (I.T. & Telecom Division) regarding the 
terms  &  conditions  of  the  transferred  employees 
whereupon  it  was  opined  that  they  were  entitled  to

3. 
Hafiz Tariq Nasim, Advocate representing the 
petitioner 
in  W.P.No.168790/2018 
(Schedule-A) 
argues that the petitioner was appointed as Telephone 
Supervisor 
upon 
recommendations 
by 
the 
Establishment Division, his terms & conditions were 
at par with those of the civil servants; that according 
to  clause  16.2  of  the  Share  Agreement  between  the 
Government  of  Pakistan  and  Etisalat  International 
Pakistan, all the transferred employees irrespective of 
their  induction  by  the  T&T  department  or  the 
Corporation  were  held  entitled  to  the  statutory 
protection  regarding  their  terms  &  conditions  of 
service. In support of his arguments, learned counsel 
has referred to Paras No.13, 14 & 18 of the judgment 
reported  as  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  and  others  v.

Mr. 
Ishtiaq  A.  Chaudhary,  Advocate 
representing  the  petitioners  in  most  of  the  petitions, 
in  addition  to  adopting  the  arguments  advanced  by 
M/s Khalid Ismail and Hafiz Tariq Nasim, Advocates 
submits  that  the  employees  who  were  transferred 
firstly  to  the  Corporation  and  then  to  the  PTCL  are 
entitled to the same perks & privileges as admissible 
to the  civil  servants; that  since the  Act  1991 did not 
repeal the  rules  applicable to  the employees of  T&T 
department, 
they  were  also  applicable 
to 
the 
employees  of  the  Corporation;  that  none  of  the 
petitioners,  being  represented  by  him,  are  either 
contract  or  work  charge  employee,  thus,  their  terms

which  were  framed  by  the  Corporation  in  the  year 
1996 could not be made applicable retrospectively to 
the  disinterest  of  the  employees  of  the  Corporation 
who  joined  prior  to  the  year  1996;  that  prior  to  the 
promulgation 
of 
the 
Act 
1996, 
the 
Telecommunication  Ordinance,  1995  was  enforced 
on 07.03.1995 and according to section 12 thereof all 
the  employees,  irrespective  of  the  fact    whether 
recruited by the Corporation or became employees of 
the  Corporation  under  section  9  of  the  Act  1991, 
were  transferred  to  the  PTCL  on  the  same  terms  & 
conditions  which  were 
applicable 
to 
them 
immediately  prior  to  their  transfer;  that  the  Apex 
Court  of  the  country  in  the  case  of  Masood  Ahmed 
Bhatti  and  others  (Supra)  has  already  held  that  the 
employees who were in service, prior to 01.01.1996, 
were governed under the statutory service regulations 
and the benefits given by the Federal Government to 
its employees from time to time  were/are admissible 
to  them,  thus,  they  are  entitled  to  revised  pay  as 
determined  by  the  Federal  Government.  Relies  on

who  are  still  serving  the  PTCL  are  being  penalized 
while re-designating their posts just to bring them out 
of the mainstream with a view to deprive them from 
service  benefits 
to  be  given  by 
the  Federal 
Government from time to time. 
7. 
Learned Assistant Attorney General states that 
as  no  relief  has  been  claimed  against  the  Federation 
rather the plea of the petitioners is that as the Federal 
Government  is  guarantor  towards  the  protection  of 
terms & conditions of the petitioners, prevalent at the 
time  of  their  transfer  to  the  Corporation  or  to  the 
PTCL, the real contest is between the petitioners and 
PTCL.  
8. 
Mr.  Shahid  Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate 
representing  PTCL  in  some  of  the  cases  argues  that 
as a matter of fact the employees who were in service 
prior  to  01.01.1991  were  governed  under  statutory 
service  rules  but  the  said  rules  are  not  applicable  to 
the  employees  who  were  inducted  in  service  by  the 
Corporation  after  01.01.1991;  that  in  none  of  the

judgments, referred by the counsel for the petitioners, 
it  has  been  held  that  the  employees  who  joined  the 
Corporation  after  1991  were  governed  under 
statutory  rules;  that  section  9  of  the  Act  1991 
empowered  the  Corporation  to  frame  rules  without 
the  intervention  of  the  government,  thus,  the  rules 
framed  under  the  said  Act  were  non-statutory  in 
nature; that as per section 59(2) of the Act 1996 only 
existing  terms  &  conditions  of  service of transferred 
employees which were applicable at the time of their 
transfer to the PTCL were protected but the said fact 
cannot  be  used  to  declare  the  Service  Regulations 
framed by the Corporation as statutory, thus, the writ 
petitions filed on behalf of the transferred employees, 
who joined the Corporation after 01.01.1991, are not 
maintainable; that the Apex Court of the country has 
already  decided  in  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Co. 
Ltd.  through  Chairman  v.  Iqbal  Nasir  and  others 
(PLD 2011 SC 132) that the employees who severed 
their  relation  with  the  department  under  VSS  were 
not  entitled  to  pensionary  benefits  admissible  to  the 
ordinary  retirees;  that  the  latest  judgment  on  the 
subject  passed  by  a  Five  Member  Bench  has  been 
reported  as  P.T.C.L.  and  others  v.  Masood  Ahmed

Shahid  and  Muhammad  Riaz  (Supra)  have  been 
revisited by the Apex Court of the country, thus, they 
cannot be quoted as precedent; that all the employees 
of  T&T  department  were  not  civil  servants  as 
according  to  section  2(b)(iii)  of  the  Civil  Servants 
Act,  1973  the  workmen  have  been  ousted  from  the 
definition of civil servant which fact has further been 
affirmed  under  clause  9  of  Second  Schedule  to 
Workmen  Compensation  Act,  1923  according  to 
which  the  persons  related  with  establishment  of 
telephone  industry  etc.  are  workmen,  thus,  these 
petitions  are  not  maintainable;  that  according  to  the 
plain  language  of  Act  1991  and  the  Act  1996  the 
employees were entitled to pay protection which was 
admissible  at  the  time  of  their  transfer  but  the  said 
fact  cannot  be  used  to  compel  the  PTCL  to  pay 
salaries to the transferred employees according to the 
rates revised by the Federal Government from time to

the  Act  1996 
though  certain 
legislative  pieces  and  actions  taken  under  the  said 
enactments were protected under section 59(2) of the 
Act, 1996 but the rules and regulations framed by the 
Corporation  were  not  given 
such  protection 
apparently  for 
the  reason 
that 
they  were  not 
applicable to the employees of the Corporation upon 
their  transfer  to  the  PTCL;  that  as  the  Share 
Agreement  was  executed  between  the  PTCL  and 
Etisalat  International  Pakistan  it  has  nothing  to  do 
with  the  terms  &  conditions  of  the  employees  who 
were  transferred from  Corporation  to  the  PTCL  thus 
the  same  cannot  be  used  to  establish  that  they  were

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable  length  and  have  also  gone  through  the 
documents,  annexed  with  these  petitions,  as  well  as 
the case-law cited at the bar. 
14. 
Firstly,  taking  up  the  plea  of  the  petitioners, 
who  joined the  Corporation  after 01.01.1991,  that  in 
view  of  the  judgment  reported  as  Masood  Ahmed 
Bhatti  and  others  (Supra)  the  employees  who  were 
serving  in  the  Corporation  prior  to  01.01.1996  were 
covered  under  statutory  rules, 
thus, 
their  writ 
petitions  are  maintainable,  I  am  of  the  humble 
opinion  that  with  a  view  to  appreciate  the  said 
contention  a  perusal  of  the  referred  judgment  is  of

“These  appeals  have  been  filed  by  three 
individual  appellants  who  admittedly  were 
civil  servants  employed by  the  Federation  in 
the  Telephone  and  Telegraph 
('T&T') 
Department  prior  to  the  enactment  of  the 
Pakistan  Telecommunication  Corporation 
'PTC  Act')……(emphasis 
Act  1991  (the 
provided). 
The  afore-quoted  portion  from  the  judgment  of  the 
august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 
leaves  no 
ambiguity  that  all  the  three  petitioners  before  the 
Apex  Court  of  the  country  in  the  referred  case  were 
those  who  were  employed  by 
the  Federal 
Government in T&T department. Subsequently, after 
promulgation of  the Act  1991,  they  were  transferred 
to the  Corporation. Further, after  enforcement of  the 
Act 1996 they were then transferred to the PTCL. In 
this scenario, the assertion of learned counsel for the 
petitioners  that  the  employees  who  were  in  service 
prior  to  01.01.1996  were  governed  under  statutory 
rules, has no substance.  
 
Moreover,  the  Apex  Court  of  the  country  in

Therefore, if an employee of the Corporation 
before his transfer to the Corporation was a 
civil  servant,  he  continues  to  be  a  civil 
servant.  In  all  other  cases,  where  an 
employee  is  appointed  in  the  service  of  the 
Corporation  after

established,  his  service  is  governed  by  the

rules,  any  action  prejudicial  taken  against 
him  in  derogation  or  in  violation  of  the  said 
rules  could  be  set  aside  by  a  writ  petition; 
however, where his terms and conditions were 
not  governed  by  statutory  rules  but  only  by 
regulations,  instructions  or  directions,  which 
the  institution  or  body,  in  which  he  was 
employed, had issued for its internal use, any 
violation  thereof  would  not,  normally,  be 
enforced  through  a  writ  petition.  Recently, 
this  Court 
in  Tanweer-ur-Rehman's  case 
(supra),  while  dealing  with  the  issue  of 
invoking  of  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court 
under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  by  the 
employees of the PIAC, held that although the 
appellant-Corporation 
performing 
functions in connection with the affairs of the 
Federation,  but  since  the  services  of  the 
respondent-employees  were  governed  by  the 
contracts executed by them with the employer, 
and  not  by  the  statutory  rules  framed  under 
section  30  of  the  Pakistan  International 
Airlines Corporation Act, 1956 with the prior 
approval  of 
the  Federal  Government, 
therefore,  they  would  be  governed  by  the 
principle  of  'Master  and  Servant'.  On  the 
question whether in absence of any breach of 
statutory  provision, 
employees  of 
appellant-Corporation  could  maintain  an 
action  for  reinstatement  etc.,  it  was  observed 
that  the  said  question  needed  no  further 
discussion  in  view  of  the  fact  that  this  Court 
was  not  of  the  opinion  that  if  a  Corporation 
was  performing  its  functions  in  connection 
with 
the 
aggrieved  persons  could  approach  the  High 
Court 
constitutional 
jurisdiction.  But  as  far  as  the  cases  of  the 
employees 
individual 
grievances  were  concerned,  it  was  held  that 
they were to be decided on their own merits, 
namely,  if  any  adverse  action  was  taken  by 
the  employer  in  violation  of  the  statutory 
rules,  only  then  such  action  would  be 
amenable to the writ jurisdiction. Therefore, 
in absence of statutory rules, the principle of 
'Master  and  Servant'  would  be  applicable

in  M. 
Tufail  Hashmi  (supra),  after  discussing  the 
aforesaid two judgments in detail, it was held 
that  the  employees  of  those  organizations, 
which  were  performing 
in 
connection  with  the  affairs  of  Federation, 
were  eligible  to  approach  the  High  Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution if their 
services  were  governed  by  statutory  rules.  It 
was further held that since the employees of 
AIOU, SME Bank and Pakistan Steel Mills, 
who  approached  the  Service  Tribunal  for 
redressal  of 
their  grievances,  were  not 
enjoying  the  protection  of  statutory  rules, 
therefore,  the  Service  Tribunal  had  no 
jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  upon  such matters 
and they would be governed by the principle 
(emphasis 
of 
provided). 
'Master  and  Servant'.” 
A  survey  of  the  afore-quoted  judgments  renders  it 
crystal clear that the employees who were transferred 
from T&T department to the Corporation and then to 
the  PTCL  were  governed  under  statutory  service 
rules,  prevalent  at  the  time  of  their  transfer  to  the 
Corporation, whereas the employees recruited by the 
Corporation  were  governed  under  non-statutory 
service  rules/regulations  in  respect  of  their  terms  & 
conditions  of  service  and  in  case  of  grievance  of  an 
individual against violation of the regulations framed 
by the Corporation under section 20 of the Act 1991 
the  constitutional  petition  was  not  maintainable,

15. 
In  support  of  their  contentions  that  the  writ 
petitions  filed  by  the  employees  who  joined  after 
01.01.1991 are maintainable, learned counsel for the 
petitioners  have  also  referred  to  the  judgment  of 
Zarai  Taraqiati  Bank  Limited  v.  Said  Rehman  and 
others (2013 SCMR 642). In my humble opinion, the 
referred  case  is  not  applicable  to  the  facts  and 
circumstances of the petitions filed by the employees 
who 
joined 
the  Corporation  after  01.01.1991 
inasmuch  as  according 
to  section  6  of 
the 
Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  (Re-
organization  &  Conversion)  Ordinance,  2002  the 
service  rules  and  regulations  applicable  to  the 
employees of the Bank at the time of their transfer to 
the  Company  were  saved  whereas  in  the  matters  of 
the  employees  of 
the  Corporation  who  were 
transferred  to  PTCL  through  certain  enactments  and 
the  actions  taken  there-under  were  protected  but  the 
service 
rules  and 
regulations 
framed  by 
the 
Corporation  were  not  given  any  protection.

shows  that  though  certain  actions  taken  under  the

specifically  given  such  protection,  thus,  it  cannot  be 
presumed  that  they  were  intact  even  after  repeal  of 
the Act 1991.  
 
It is added that when the parent statute viz. the 
Act 1991 was repealed, how the rules framed by the 
relevant  authority  while  exercising  its  powers  under 
the  said  Act  could  remain  in  field  especially  when 
they  were  not  saved  under  the  repealing/saving

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  being 
swayed  with  the  observation  of  the  august  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  that  the  Corporation  falls  within 
the definition of person in terms of Article 199(5) of 
the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, 
1973  have  argued that  the  writ  petitions  filed  by  the 
employees,  who 
joined 
the  Corporation  after 
01.01.1991,  are  maintainable.  Perhaps, 
learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  contended  so  in 
oblivion  of  the  fact  that  maintainability  of  a  writ 
petition by the employees is determined on the basis 
of the relevant service rules/regulations. So far as the 
cases  filed  by  the  employees,  who  joined  the

such employees are not maintainable. 
17.  While  opposing  the  submissions  made  by 
learned counsel for the petitioners, who were initially 
appointed  in  T&T  department,  that  they  are  entitled 
to  same  benefits 
introduced  by 
the  Federal 
Government  from  time  to  time,  Mr.  Shahid  Anwar

protection  does  not  mean  payment  of  salary  by  the 
Corporation  or  the  PTCL  according  to  the  rates 
revised  by  the  Federal  Government  from  time  to 
time.  In  this  regard,  I  disagree  with  learned  counsel 
for  the  PTCL  for  the  reason  that  in  the  case  of 
P.T.C.L.  and  others  v.  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  and

employees  of  the  Corporation  under  section  9  of 
the  Act  of  1991  and  then  of  the  PTCL  under

conditions  of  service  were  fully  protected  under 
section 9(2) of the Act of 1991 and 35(2) of the Act 
of 1996. None of the terms and conditions could be 
varied to their disadvantage as is provided by the 
sections  reproduced  above.  Not  only  that  the 
legislature also bound the Federal Government to 
guarantee  the  existing  terms  and  conditions  of 
service and rights including pensionary benefits of 
the transferred employees. Since they by virtue of 
the aforesaid provisions became employees of the

Further,  Mr.  Shahid  Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate  while 
appearing in Crl. Org. Petitions No.53 & 54 of 2015 
before 
the  Apex  Court  of 
the  country  gave 
undertaking that the PTCL would give pension to the 
petitioners except VSS optees alongwith the increase 
announced  by  the  Federal  Government  from  time  to 
time. Though learned counsel representing the PTCL 
has  argued  that  his  statement  was  confined  only  to 
the  petitioners  in  the  said  contempt  petitions  but  the 
said fact suggests that the transferred employees who 
were  initially  appointed  in  T&T  department  are 
entitled to the same perks & privileges announced by 
the  Federal  Government  from  time  to  time  for  its 
employees.  In  this  backdrop, the  respondents  cannot 
be  allowed  to  treat  the  similarly  placed  persons 
distinctly  especially  when  the  Apex  Court  of  the 
country  has  already  concluded  that  the  employees 
who were transferred from T&T department, despite

18.  While opposing the writ petitions filed by the 
employees  who  initially  were  appointed  by  the 
Federal Government in T&T department, Mr. Shahid 
Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate  has  argued  that  after 
establishment of the PTCL it cannot be compelled to 
pay  pensionary  emoluments  to  the  retirees.  Perhaps, 
learned  counsel  for  PTCL  has  raised  such  plea  in 
oblivion of the fact that the pension to the transferred 
employees  was  to  be  paid  from  the  Pension  Fund, 
established  under  section  45  of  the  Act  1996.  There 
is  no  denying  the  fact  that  the  PTCL  has  obligation 
towards  contribution  in  the  said  Fund  but  the  said 
fact  cannot  be  used  to  argue  that  the  burden  of 
pension is to be borne exclusively by the PTCL. 
19.  Mr.  Shahid  Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate  while 
arguing  that  the  Apex  Court  of  the  country  has 
allowed the respondents to raise all objections before 
the  forums  where  proceedings  are  pending,  has 
referred  to  order,  dated  17.05.2017,  passed  by  the

A  cursory  glance  over  the  afore-quoted  judgment  of 
the  Apex  Court  of  the  country  makes  it  abundantly 
clear  that  the  judgment  under  review  in  the  said 
matter  was  not  set  aside  rather  the  department  was 
permitted to file application under section 12(2) CPC 
in  the  matters  wherein  the  employees  succeeded  to 
get orders in their favour while playing fraud with the 
Court. Further, they were also allowed to raise all the 
objections  in  the  pending  cases,  however,  the  said 
observation  cannot  be  used  to  reopen  a  point  before 
this  Court  which  has  already  been  put  to  rest  by  the 
Apex  Court  of  the  country.  Reference  in  this  regard 
can  be  made  to  the  case  reported  as  Pakistan 
International  Airlines  Corporation  v.  Aziz-ur-
Rehman Chaudhry and another (2016 SCMR 14). 
20.  Now  taking  up  the  question  relating  to  the 
applicability of the principle of laches, raised by Mr. 
Shahid  Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate,  I  am  of  the  view 
that  as  non-payment  of  salary/pension  according  to 
revised  rates  introduced  by  the  Federal  Government

21.  Mr.  Shahid  Anwar  Bajwa,  Advocate,  during 
the course of arguments, tried to establish that as the 
petitioners  fell  within  the  definition  of  workmen  in 
view  of  clause  9  of  Second  Schedule  attached  with 
the  Workmen  Compensation  Act,  1923,  they  were 
estopped  to  approach  this  Court.  The  said  query  has 
already  been  responded  by  the  Apex  Court  of  the

hence  similar  duties  and  functions  in  the

accordingly,  the  grievance  of  the  private 
respondents  was  amenable  to  the  writ 
jurisdiction of the High Court. However, it 
was  observed  that  the  status  of  the  private 
respondents, be that of a 'worker' or a 'civil 
servant'  or  a  'contract  employee'  had  no

replaced  with

12  of  the  Telecommunication  Ordinance,  1995  is 
misconceived. 
23.  Now taking up the plea of Hafiz Tariq Nasim, 
Advocate that as the petitioner, being represented by 
him,  was  appointed  in  the  Corporation  on  the 
recommendations  of  the  Establishment  Division  he 
falls within the category of civil servant. I am unable 
to subscribe to the view point of the learned counsel 
for the reason that just intervention of Establishment 
Division in the recruitment without any support from 
the  relevant  law  did  not  render  the  status  of  the 
employee  as  civil  servant  rather  the  same  was  to  be 
determined  according 
to 
the  applicable  service 
rules/regulations. Insofar as the case under discussion 
is concerned, suffice it to note that  after induction in 
service the terms & conditions of the employees who 
were  recruited  by  the  Corporation  were  governed 
under  the  non-statutory  service  rules/regulations

taking  up  communication,  dated 
05.04.2013,  addressed  by 
the  Section  Officer 
(Coordination),  Govt.  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of 
Information  &  Technology 
(I.T.  &  Telecom 
Division)  to  the  President/CEO  PTCL  Headquarters, 
Islamabad,  I  am  of  the  view  that  there  is  no  cavil 
with  the  proposition  that  the  transferred  employees 
were  entitled  to  same  perks  &  privileges  admissible 
to  them  at  the  time  of  their  transfer  but  the  moot 
question  before  this  Court  is  the  maintainability  of 
the  writ  petitions  by  the  employees  who  joined  the 
Corporation  after  01.01.1991.  They  might  have  a 
genuine  grievance  but  they  are/were  supposed  to 
approach the forum concerned. 
25. 
The  mainstay  of  the  arguments  advanced  by 
the learned counsel for the petitioners is Section 8 of 
the  Act  1996.  There  is  no  cavil  with  the  proposition 
that  under  section  8  ibid  the  power  to  issue  policy 
directives  lies  with  the  Federal  Government  but  the 
said power cannot be used to render the status of the 
service  rules/regulations,  framed  by  the  Corporation

without intervention of the government, as statutory. 
Further,  the  point  pressed  into  service  by  learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioners  that  as  the  employees  of 
the  Corporation  were  transferred  to  PTCL  due  to 
statutory  intervention  their  terms  &  conditions  are 
statutory in nature does not appeal to reason because 
the service rules and regulations prevalent at the time 
of their transfer being non-statutory the enactment of 
the  Act  1996,  by  virtue  of  which  PTCL  was 
established,  cannot  be  used  to  change  the  nature  of 
said  service  regulations.  Moreover,  inconsistency  on 
the  part  of  the  petitioners  is  manifest  from  the  fact 
that  on  the  one  hand  they  took  the  plea  that  as  the 
service  regulations  were  framed  by  the  Corporation 
in  the  year  1996  same  could  not  be  used  to  the 
disinterest  of  the  employees  of  the  Corporation  who 
joined it prior to framing of said rules/regulations and 
on 
the  other  have  placed  reliance  on  certain 
provisions  of  the  Act  1996  which  did  not  provide 
protection  to  the  service  rules/regulations  framed  by 
the Corporation. 
26.  With  a  view  to  establish  that  the  petitioners 
are  entitled  to  the  revised  pay  and  pension,  learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  referred  to  the

2015.  According  to  my  understanding  the  said 
statement can be helpful for the employees who were 
initially  appointed  in  T&T  department  but  the  same 
cannot  be  used  in  the  cases  of  the  employees  who 
were  recruited  by  the  Corporation  after  01.01.1991 
for  the  reason  that  the  petitioners  in  the  contempt

clause  16  of  the  said  agreement  relates  to  the 
transferred  employees  but  it  has  nowhere  been 
mentioned  that  the  PTCL  was  divested  to  frame 
rules/regulations  regarding  terms  &  conditions  of  its 
employees. The only condition precedent for exercise 
of  such  powers  is  that  terms  &  conditions  of  the 
employees transferred from the Corporation to PTCL 
would not be changed to their disadvantage.

In  some  of  the  petitions,  the  employees  who 
opted  for  VSS  have  also  prayed  for  grant  of 
pensionary  benefits  admissible 
to 
the  ordinary 
retirees.  Since  the  petitioners  in  such  cases  availed

29.  At the cost of repetition, it is clarified that the 
transferred  employees  are  entitled  to  same  terms  & 
conditions  which  were  prevalent  at  the  time  of  their 
transfer  from  the  Corporation  to  PTCL  in  view  of 
section 36(2) of the Act, 1996 but the question again 
is the maintainability of the petitions on behalf of the 
employees  whose  terms  &  conditions  prior  to  their 
transfer in PTCL were governed under non-statutory 
service rules/regulations. If any act is being done by 
the  PTCL  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Act 
1996 the aggrieved persons can resort to appropriate 
proceedings. 
30.  Now  coming  to  the  case-law  referred  by 
learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  I  am  of  the  view 
that  the  same  is  not  applicable  to  the  facts  and 
circumstances of the petitions filed by the employees 
who  were  recruited  by 
the  Corporation  after 
01.01.1991  as  in  none  of  the  cases  it  has  been  held 
that  the  writ  petitions  on  behalf  of the  employees  of 
the  Corporation  whose  terms  &  conditions  were 
governed

non-statutory 
service 
rules/

regulations  were  maintainable.  Further,  when  the 
Apex  Court  of  the  country  in  the  cases,  discussed 
above,  has  held 
that 
the  employees  of 
the 
Corporation  could  not  approach  this  Court  while 
invoking  its  Constitutional  jurisdiction  vested  under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, the petitions filed by such employees 
cannot be held maintainable. 
31.  Mr.  Ishtiaq  A.  Chaudhary  Advocate  has 
argued 
that  since 
the  agreement  between 
the 
Government  of  Pakistan  and  Etisalat  International 
Pakistan  is  going  to  expire  in  the  year  2021,  the 
control  of  PTCL  shall  again  be  held  by 
the 
Government  of  Pakistan, 
thus, 
the  present 
administration  cannot  be  allowed  to  introduce  any 
scheme  prejudicial  to  the  service  benefits  of  the 
transferred  employees.  In  this  regard,  I  am  of  the 
view  that  these  petitions  are  to  be  decided  on  the 
basis of law applicable at this particular point and by 
no stretch of imagination they can be decided on the 
basis of any future happening.     
32.  Mr.  Ishtiaq  A.  Chaudhary  Advocate  has 
repeatedly  argued  that  as  the  judgment  in  Iqbal

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

Nasir’s case has been revisited by the Apex Court of 
the  country 
the  same  cannot  be  used 
to 
the 
disadvantage  of  the  petitioners.  A  perusal  of  the 
judgment, reported as P.T.C.L. and others v. Masood 
Ahmed Bhatti and others (2016 SCMR 1362) affirms 
that  though  the  judgment  in  Iqbal  Nasir’s  case  has 
been distinguished on the ground that the employees 
initially  appointed  in  T&T  department  are  amenable 
to  writ  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  violation  of  their 
terms  &  conditions  of  service  but  neither  the  view 
taken  in  the  said  case  has  been  reviewed  nor  it  has 
specifically  been  held that the  writ petitions  filed by 
the  persons  who 
joined 
the  Corporation  after 
01.01.1991 are maintainable. 
33.  As  a  necessary  corollary  to  the  discussion 
made in the foregoing paragraphs I have reached the 
following irresistible conclusions; - 
i. 
That 
the  petitioners,  who  were 
initially 
appointed 
in 
T&T 
department,  have  competently  filed 
writ  petitions  and  they  are  entitled  to 
same perks & privileges as admissible 
to  other  employees  of  the  Federal 
Government 
alongwith  periodical 
increases;  hence 
respondents  are

ii. 
That the Writ Petitions, filed by those 
who 
joined 
the  Corporation  after 
01.01.1991,  are  not  maintainable  and 
in  case  of  any  grievance  they  can 
resort to appropriate proceedings. 
iii.  That  the  petitioners  who  opted  for 
VSS are not entitled to the pensionary 
benefits  as  admissible  to  the  ordinary 
retirees. 
Consequently, all these petitions are disposed of in 
the above terms. 
34. 
Before  parting  with  this  order,  it  is  observed 
that in some of the cases it is not clear as to when the 
petitioners  joined,  in  case  of  any  ambiguity  their 
status shall be adjudged on the basis of the record of 
the department.
