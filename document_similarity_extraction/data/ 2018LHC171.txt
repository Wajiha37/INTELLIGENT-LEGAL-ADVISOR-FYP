Through  this  Application,  filed  under  Order  I  Rule  10  CPC,  the 
Applicants  seek  permission  to  be  impleaded  as  party  to  the  Appeal.

Khan  Mengal  and  others  v.  Muhammad  Afzal  Shouq  and  others

others (2007 SCMR 882). 
In view of above, the  Application is allowed and the Applicants 
are made party to the Appeal as Respondents.  
Main Case 
 
JAWAD  HASSAN,  J:-    Through  this  single  judgment  we  intend 
to decide the instant Intra Court Appeal as well as I.C.A. No.362/2017 
titled  “Pakistan  Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Ltd. v. 
         
ICA N0.361 /2017 
ICA No.362/2017

Col. (R) Ghafoor Arshad etc.” through which the validity of order dated 
07.03.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P. No.21953/2016 
whereby the writ Petitions of the Respondents No.1 to 30 were allowed, 
has been challenged. 
2.   Brief facts of the case are that in pursuance of the advertisement 
made    by  the  Appellant  in  the  newspaper    on  09.04.2013,  the 
Respondents  No.1  to  30  were  appointed  by  the  Selection  Board 
constituted  by 
the  Appellant.  The  appointment 
letters 
to 
the 
Respondents  No.1  to  30  were  issued  in  different  dates  in  May  2013. 
Subsequently,  the  said  Board  extended  the  contract  period  of  the 
Respondents No.1 to 30. The Staff Union of the Appellant (the Union) 
filed  a  complaint  before  the  Appellant  that  the  entire  process  for  the 
appointment  of  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30  was  not  carried  out  in 
transparent  manner,  hence  Board  of  the  Appellant  conducted  a  fact 
finding  inquiry  which  was  concluded  on  08.11.2013  with  the  findings 
that  the  correct  procedure  was  followed  for  appointment  of  the 
Respondents  No.1  to  30  as  per  law  and  policies.  The  Union  again 
approached  different  forums  against  the  recruitment  process  of  the 
Respondents No.1 to 30 and on the directions of the Prime Minister, the 
Appellant  reopened  the  inquiry.  Whereupon  the  inquiry  report  dated 
27.05.2016  was  submitted  with  the  recommendation  that  the  MD  and 
GM  (HR)  being  competent  authority  for  the  recruitment  may  be 
proceeded  against under the relevant  rules  and the  recruitment process 
of  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30  was  declared  to  be  based  on 
irregularities  and  illegalities.  Hence,  vide  order  dated  02.06.2016  the 
 
 
         
ICA N0.361 /2017 
ICA No.362/2017

Respondents  No.1  to  30  were  declared  ceased  to  be  the  employees  of 
the Appellant with immediate effect. The Respondents No.1 to 30 filed 
writ petitions there-against which was allowed. Hence these Appeals.          
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  inter  alia  submitted  that  the 
impugned order is against law and facts and liable to be set aside; that 
infact  vide  order  dated  02.06.2016  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30 
alongwith other employees’ contract already stood expired were laid off 
from  the  strength  of  the  Appellant;  that  as  the  Appellant  does  not  fall 
within  the  definition  of  ‘person’  therefore,  the  writ  petitions  were  not 
maintainable; that the learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate  the 
fact    that  the  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the  Respondents 
No.1 to 30 is that of master and servant; that the rules of the Appellant 
are non-statutory in nature; that the services of the Respondents No.1 to 
30  were  contractual  in  nature  therefore,    despite  the  remedy  of  writ 
petitions, the Respondents No.1 to 30 had the alternate remedy by filing 
civil suits. Learned counsel for the Appellant has placed reliance on the 
case 
titled  Justice  Khurshid  Anwar  Bhinder  and 
  others  v. 
Federatonof  Pakistan  and  another  (PLD  2010  SC  483),    Brig  (R) 
Sakhi  Marjan,  CEO,  PESCO,  Peshawar  v.  Managing  Director 
PEPCO,  Lahore  and    others  (2009  SCMR  708)  and  Pakistan 
Telecommunication  Co.  Ltd.  through  Chairman  v.  Iqbal  Nasir  and 
others (PLD 2011 SC  132). 
4. 
On  the  other  hand  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents  No.1  to 
30  vehemently  controverted  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  Appellant  and  prayed  for  dismissal  of  the  Appeal.

Learned counsel in support of his arguments has placed reliance on the 
case  titled  Muhammad  Rafi  and  another  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan 
and  others  (2016  SCMR  2146)  and  Government  of  the  Punjab 
through Chief Secretary and others v. Aamir Junaid and others (2015 
SCMR 74). 
5.         We have heard the arguments of both the sides and perused the 
record.  
6. 
The  bare  reading  of  the  order  dated  02.06.2016  reveals  that 
neither any show cause notice has been issued to the Respondents No.1 
to 30 nor any opportunity of personal hearing has been afforded to them 
before  passing  the  same  rather,  it  has  been  observed  therein  that  in 
compliance  of  the  inquiry  report  from  M/o  NFS&R  No.1-13/2013  FS 
dated  27.05.2016  and  directions  contained  therein,  the  contract 
employees  (list  attached)  stands  ceased  to  be  the  employees  of 
PASSCO with immediate effect. The impugned order was passed solely 
relying upon the inquiry report which shows that the Inquiry Committee 
interviewed  the  concerned  Officers  of  PASSCO,  President  (then  GM 
HR).  The  Inquiry  Committee  also  interviewed  the  Ex-President  of  All 
Pakistan  PASSCO  Staff  Union  (CBA)  (Complainant)  as  well  as  the 
present President of the CBA to have a clear idea regarding illegalities 
in the recruitment process. The whole inquiry proceedings show that the 
Respondents  No.1  to  30  were  not  heard.  Moreover,  the  Inquiry 
Committee  concluded  its  findings  to  the  effect  that  owing  to  these 
illegalities  and  irregularities  the  Committee  has  reached  to  the 
conclusion  that  Formal  Inquiry  may  be  conducted  under  PASSCO 
 
 
         
ICA N0.361 /2017 
ICA No.362/2017 
 
 5 
Employees Service (Efficiency & Disciplinary) Regulations, 2007 (the 
“Regulations”)  to  fix  the  responsibility  against  the  defaulting  officers 
as  well  as  the  selected  candidates.  But  the  record  reveals    that  the 
Respondents No.1 to 30 were ousted through the impugned order dated 
02.06.2016  without  adopting  the  proper  procedure  as  set  down  in  the 
Inquiry  Report  viz:  PASSCO  Employees  Service  (Efficiency  & 
Disciplinary)  Regulations,  2007.  Consequently, 
the  order  dated 
02.06.2016 infringed the fundamental rights of the Respondents No.1 to 
30  guaranteed  under  Article  4  of  the  Constitution  as  to  enjoy  the 
protection  of  law  and  to  be  treated  in  accordance  with  law  is  the 
inalienable right of every citizen. 
7. 
From the above, it is very much clear that since there are serious 
allegations  against  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30  and  their  Officers  for 
committing  illegalities  and  irregularities  in  the  appointment  of  the 
Respondents  No.1  to  30, therefore, they  should  have  been  afforded  an 
opportunity  of  fair  trial  and  personal  hearing.  But  no  personal  hearing 
was given to the Respondents No.1 to 30 before passing the order dated 
02.06.2016.  Although  it  is  a  developed  jurisprudence  by  the  superior 
Courts that this Court cannot interfere into the contractual matters yet in 
this case  evidently, neither the  Respondents  No.1  to 30  were  provided 
opportunity  of  fair  trial,  particularly  when  there  is  serious  allegation 
against  them,  nor  the  required  procedure  as  advised  in  the  Inquiry 
Report was adopted to proceed against  them. The Respondents No.1 to 
30 should not have been terminated with a single stroke of pen rather in 
due  course  of  law  as  suggested  in  the  Inquiry  Report  i.e.  under  the 
 
 
         
ICA N0.361 /2017 
ICA No.362/2017 
 
 6 
Regulations.  Furthermore,  the  Appellant  passed  the  impugned  order 
dated  02.06.2016  for  termination of the  Respondents  No.1 to  30 but it 
did  not  adopt  the  proper  procedure  as  contained  in  the  Inquiry  Report 
i.e.  formal  inquiry  against  the  Respondents  No.1 to  30  alongwith  their 
Officers  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations.  Therefore,  the 
action  of  the  Appellant  against  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30  is  itself 
contradictory and against the principle of natural justice.    
8. 
As  such,  the  learned  Single  Judge  has  rightly  held  in  the 
impugned  order  that  passing  the  order  dated  02.06.2016  without  any 
reasoning  and  in  absence  of  opportunity  of  personal  hearing,  there  is 
violation  of  natural  justice  and  the  Respondents  No.1  to  30  have  been 
deprived  of  their  fundamental  right  of  fair  trial  and  due  process 
guaranteed  under  Article  10-A  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). Recently, the Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  Pakistan  Defence  Officers 
Housing Authority v. Mrs. Itrat Sajjad Khan and others (2017 SCMR 
2010) has held as under: 
 
“However,  the  question  which  escaped  the  attention  of 
the  High  Court  and  needs  our  consideration  is  as  to 
whether Rule 8(b)(1) of the Service  Rules framed by the 
appellant  in  2008  for  their  employees  which  authorizes 
the  Administrator  to  dispense  with  the  services  of  an 
employee by giving him one month's notice or a month's 
pay  in  lieu  thereof  without  assigning  any  reason  or 
providing  an  opportunity  of  hearing  is  violative  of  the 
principle  of  natural  justice,  which  always  has  been 
 
 
         
ICA N0.361 /2017 
ICA No.362/2017 
 
 7 
treated as violation of law. The said rule further appears 
to  be  against  the  principles  of  public  policy  which 
requires 
the 
public 
functionaries 
to  maintain 
transparency  and  to  exercise  their  powers  in  good  faith 
in  the  public  interest  and  not  on  the  basis  of  personal 
likes or dislikes or on the basis of whims and fancies and, 
therefore, it needs to be examined as to whether such rule 
could  be  allowed  to  be  retained  in  the  service  rules 
(though  non-statutory)  of  the  appellant  a  statutory 
body.”   
 
9. 
Reliance  can  also  be  placed  on  the  case  titled  Muhammad 
Ashraf Tiwana and others v. Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 1159) 
wherein it was held that to sum up the discussion in this part, when we 
read  the  Act  in  the  light  of  principles  elaborated  repeatedly  in  our 
precedents,  it  becomes  clear  that  the  SECP  cannot  simply  be 
terminating  the  services  of  its  employees  at  its  whims  and  pleasure, 
without  having  recourse  to  valid  reasons.  It  can  only  terminate  an 
employment  when  it  has  reasons  to  do  so  which  are  fair  and  just  and 
advance  the  purposes  of  the  Act.  Both  law  and  public  policy  require 
this.  The  judgments  cited  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant 
cannot  be  relied  upon  as  each  and  every  case  has  its  own  facts  and 
circumstances, as such distinguishable from the case in hand.   
10.  We, therefore, agree with the findings of the learned Single Judge 
and do not see any illegality or perversity in the impugned order which 
has  been  passed  in  accordance  with  law  and  does  not  warrant  any 
interference by this Court; consequently, the impugned order is upheld

and  the  instant  Appeal  as  well  as  ICA  No.362/2017,  being  devoid  of 
any merit, are hereby dismissed.
