Mr. Muhammad  Mumtaz  Faridi, Advocate  for 
respondent No.3.                                        
Javaid,  Advocate 
for 
   Through  this  constitutional  petition  under 
Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  the  petitioner-
department  has  assailed  the  judgment  dated 
24.06.2015  passed  by  respondent  No.1/Punjab 
Labour  Appellate  Tribunal,  Lahore  whereby 
the  judgment  dated  29.11.2013  passed  by 
respondent  No.2/Punjab  Labour  Court  No.1, 
Lahore, was upheld.   
2.  Concisely,  the  facts  necessary  for  disposal 
of 
this  constitutional  petition  are 
that 
respondent  No.3  was  appointed  as  Assistant 
Line Man on 14.02.1977 on work charge basis, 
his  services  were  regularized  on  26.12.1978 
and  he  was  also  promoted  to  the  rank  of  Line 
Man-II  on  02.05.1981  and  Line  Man-I  on 
13.12.1993.  At  the  time  of  his  appointment 
respondent  No.3  provided  his  date  of  birth  as 
10.10.1960  and  the  same  date  of  birth  is 
mentioned  in  his  matriculation  certificate  and 
Computerized  National  Identity  Card.  But  due 
to  tampering,  the  date  of  birth  of  respondent 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
2 
No.3  was  written  as  10.10.1950  in  his  Service 
Book.  It  is  averred  by  respondent  No.3  that  in 
the  year  2006  his  date  of  birth  i.e  10.10.1960 
was  disputed.  Respondent  No.3  produced  his 
original  matriculation  certificate  which  was 
sent 
for  verification 
to 
the  Board  of 
Intermediate 
and 
Secondary  Education, 
Sargodha,  who  verified  the  genuineness  of  his 
matriculation  certificate.  Respondent  No.3 
further  averred  that  in  order  to  deprive  him 
from  his  service 
the  petitioner-department 
wrote  a  letter  dated  25.01.2007  to  Medical 
Superintendent  WAPDA  Complex,  Lahore  for 
determination/assessment  of  his  date  of  birth. 
The petitioner-department vide impugned order 
dated  26.01.2009  changed  the  date  of  birth  of 
respondent  No.3 
from 
10.10.1960 
to 
10.10.1950.    Feeling  aggrieved,  respondent 
No.3 challenged the said order in Writ Petition 
No.4267/2009 before this Court. In the light of 
judgment dated 15.12.2010 passed in the above 
said  Writ  Petition  respondent  No.3  was  retired 
from 
service  w.e.f 
10.10.2010.  Being 
dissatisfied with the said judgment, respondent 
No.3  sent  a  grievance  notice  to  petitioner-
department  which  was  not  replied  and  then  he 
filed  a  petition  before  respondent  No.2  which 
was  accepted  vide  impugned  judgment  dated 
29.11.2013.  The  petitioner-department  filed 
appeal  against  the  said  judgment  which  was 
dismissed  by  respondent  No.1.  Hence,  the 
present petition.      
3.  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner-department 
contends  that  judgments  of  the  learned  Punjab 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
3 
Labour Court No.1, Lahore and learned Punjab 
Labour  Appellate  Tribunal,  Lahore  are  the 
result of misreading and non-reading of oral as 
well as  documentary  evidence  available on the 
record;  that  earlier  writ  petition  filed  by 
respondent  No.3  before 
this  Court  was 
dismissed;  and 
that  regular  enquiry  was 
conducted  whereby  it  was  concluded  that  date 
of birth of respondent No.3 is 10.10.1950.  
4.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 
respondent  No.3  supported 
the 
impugned 
judgments  of  learned  Punjab  Labour  Court 
No.1,  Lahore  and 
learned  Punjab  Labour 
Appellate Tribunal, Lahore. 
5.  Heard. Record perused. 
6.  Respondent  No.3  appeared  as  PW-2  in 
order  to  prove  his  case  and  tendered  in  his 
evidence photocopy of matriculation certificate 
(Exh.P/6),  photocopy  of  old  National  Identity 
Card Mark  P/B,  Photo  copy  of  CNIC  Exh.P/7, 
final  seniority 
list  Exh.P/8, 
letter  dated 
09.05.2006  Exh.P/9,  verification 
letter  of 
Sargodha  Board  Exh.P/10, 
letter  dated 
25.07.2011  regarding  medical  examination 
Exh.P/11,  letter  dated  26.06.2007  Exh.P/12, 
letter  dated  15.12.2006  Exh.P/13,  office  order 
dated  26.01.2009  Exh.P/14,  copy  of  judgment 
dated  15.12.2010  passed  by 
this  Court 
Exh.P/15, grievance notice Exh.P/16 and postal 
receipt Exh.P/17. 
7.  The  case  of  the  petitioner-department  in 
reply 
to 
the  grievance  petition  was 
that 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
4 
respondent  No.3  is  guilty  of  tampering/over-
writing of his date of birth i.e. 10.10.1950 into 
10.10.1960.  It  will  not  be  out  of  place  to 
mention here that neither a single question nor 
any suggestion was put to respondent No.3 that 
he  had  tampered  his  date  of  birth  from 
10.10.1950  to  10.10.1960.  Respondent  No.3 
was  not  confronted  while  conducting  cross-
examination 
that  service  book  has  been 
tampered by him. 
8. 
In  order  to  prove  his  case,  the  petitioner-
department  produced  RW-1  Zameer  Hussain, 
Manager HR LESCO. He in his examination in 
chief stated that at the time of appointment the 
date of birth of respondent No.3 was written as 
10.10.1950  in  his  Service  Book  which  was 
subsequently changed as 10.10.1960. It will not 
be out of place to mention here that he had not 
stated  that  tampering  of  the  date  of  birth  had 
been made by respondent No.3. It is established 
principle  of  law  that  pleadings  by  themselves 
are  not 
the  proof  and  same  are 
to  be 
substantiated  by  producing  evidence.  As  the 
petitioner-department  has  failed  to  substantiate 
his  stance  taken  in  the  reply  to  the  grievance 
petition  by  producing  evidence,  therefore,  it 
can  safely  be  said 
that 
the  petitioner-
department  has  miserably  failed  to  establish 
that  conversion  of  date  of  birth 
from 
10.10.1950  to  10.10.1960  has  been  tampered 
by  respondent  No.3.  It  is  also  an  established 
principle of law that pleadings are not evidence 
by  themselves  and  do  not  prove  the  assertions 
made  therein,  rather  the  contents  thereof  have 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
5 
to  be  proved  through  testimony  given  on  oath 
and  subject  to  cross-examination  by  the  other 
side.  The  pleadings  which  have  not  been 
confronted  to  the  maker,  are  not  sufficient  to 
prove  the  contents  of  the  same  and  cannot  be 
read in evidence as proof of the contents stated 
therein.    Further  it  has  been  held  in  a  case 
reported as Mst. Khair-ul-Nisa and 6 others V. 
Malik  Muhammad  Ishaque and 2 others  (PLD 
1972  Supreme  Court  25) 
that  written 
statements  are  to  be  proved  through  evidence. 
The  statements  made  in  the  written  statement 
are  not  on  oath.  They  are  only  verified  and, 
therefore, they cannot be treated as evidence in 
the  case.  In  a  case  reported  as  Muhammad 
Saleh  V.  Deputy Commissioner,  Tharparkar at 
Mirpurkhas  and  others  [PLD  1963  (W.P.) 
Karachi  613] 
it  has  been  held 
that  the 
pleadings cannot take the place of evidence. In 
another  case  reported  as  Taj  Muhammad  V. 
Raza Haider and another (1993 MLD 2450) it 
has  been  held  that  the  pleadings  are  not  the 
evidence  in  the  case.  In  another  case  reported 
as  Nizamuddin  V.  Qamaruddin  Jaffar  Vallani 
and another (1991 CLC 1937) it has been held 
that there is no cavil for the proposition that the 
pleadings  cannot  be  treated  as  a  substitute  for 
the  evidence.  Further  reliance  in  this  regard  is 
placed  on  a  case  reported  as  Muhammad  Ilyas 
and  others  V.  Muhammad  Sharif  and  others 
(2001 CLC 1194).  In another case reported as 
Muhamamd Nawaz alias Nawaza and others V. 
Member Judicial Board of Revenue and others 
(2014  SCMR  914)  it  has  been  held  by  the 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
6 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  the 
averments  made  in  the  pleadings  do  not 
constitute evidence. 
9.  Respondent  No.3  has  produced  on  record 
convincing 
  evidence 
in 
the  shape  of 
Matriculation  Certificate  which  is  Exh.P/6, 
which  was  got  verified  by  the  petitioner-
department from  Sargodha  Board  who verified 
the  date  of  birth  of  respondent  No.3  as 
10.10.1960.  The  said  verification  has  not  been 
challenged  by 
the  petitioner-department, 
therefore,  it  will  be  presumed  that  they  have 
accepted  the  verification  as  correct.  Reference 
may  be  made  to  a  case  reported  as  Sher  Baz 
Khan  and  others  V.  Mst.  Malkni  Sahibzadi 
Tiwana  and  others  (PLD  2003  Supreme 
Court  849)  wherein  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  has  authoritatively  held  that 
in  preference  to  the  oral  or  other  version  with 
regard 
to 
the  age, 
the  one  recorded 
in 
matriculation certificate would be considered as 
unimpeachable  evidence. 
  In  another  case 
reported as Muhammad Arshad and another V. 
Mian  Noor  Ahmad  and  others  (2008  SCMR 
713),  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 
has  given  preference 
to 
the  matriculation 
certificate  issued  by  the  Board  of  Intermediate 
and Secondary Education, Karachi as compared 
to  other  documents  i.e  birth  certificate  and 
National Identity Card. In another case reported 
as  Malik  Muhammad  Faisal  and  another  V. 
State  Life  Insurance  Corporation 
through 
Chairman,  Karachi  and  2  others  (PLD  2007 
Lahore  453)  this  Court  has  held  that  the 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
7 
correct and true date of birth would be the one 
as  recorded  in  the  school/Board  record  being 
earliest in time.   
10.  Exh.P/8,  which  is  final  seniority  list  of 
ALM/LESCO 
issued  by 
the  petitioner-
department  also  bears  the  date  of  birth  of 
respondent No.3 as 10.10.1960. The same is the 
case  with  NIC  Exh.P/7,  which  bears  date  of 
birth of respondent No.3 as 10.10.1960. It will 
not  be  out  of  place  to  mention  here  that  in  the 
Matriculation  Certificate  of  respondent  No.3 
issued  by  BISE,  Sargodha  on  30.06.1976  the 
date  of  birth  of  respondent  No.3  has  been 
recorded  as  10.10.1960  whereas  respondent 
No.3  has  joined  his  service  on  14.02.1977, 
therefore, there is no chance of tampering in the 
said certificate of respondent No.3.  
11.  On  the  other  hand,  petitioner-department 
heavily relied upon Exh.R/2 (report of Scrutiny 
Committee  qua  date  of  birth  of  respondent 
No.3),  whereby  date  of  birth  of  respondent 
No.3 was determined by Scrutiny Committee as 
10.10.1950.  From  bare  perusal  of 
this 
document,  it  appears  that  same  has  been 
passed/issued  without  associating  respondent 
No.3  with  the  proceedings  of  the  Committee 
which is against the principle of natural justice. 
No further document has been placed on record 
by  petitioner-department  whereby  it  can  show 
that respondent No.3 has been given chance of 
producing  his  evidence  or  conducting  cross 
examination  on  the  witness  of  the  petitioner-
department.  Therefore,  this  document  carries 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
8 
no weight in the eye of law. It is a principle of 
natural justice that no one should be dealt with 
to  his  material  disadvantage  or  deprived  of  his 
liberty  or  property  without  having  an 
opportunity  of  being  heard  and  making  his 
defence.  Reliance  in  this  regard  is  placed  on  a 
case  reported  as  Chief  Commissioner,  Karachi 
and another V. Mrs. Dina Sohrab Katrak (PLD 
1959  Supreme  Court  (Pak.)  45).  Further 
reliance  is  placed  on  cases  titled  Messrs 
Fardsons  Ltd,  Karachi  V.  Government  of 
Pakistan,  through  its  Secretary,  Ministry  of 
Commerce,  Karachi  (PLD  1961  Supreme 
Court  537),  Province  of  East  Pakistan  and 
another  V.  Nur  Ahmad  and  another  (PLD  1964 
Supreme  Court  451) and Abdus Saboor Khan 
V.  Karachi  University  (PLD  1966  Supreme 
Court 536).   As respondent No.3 has not been 
heard  by  the  Scrutiny  Committee  constituted 
for  determination  of  his  correct  date  of  birth, 
therefore,  the  age  determined  by  the  said 
Committee is nullity  in the eye of law and has 
no  legal  effect.    Reliance  in  this  regard  is 
placed  on  Superintendent  of  Police,  Special 
Branch,  Karachi  and  others  V.  Abubakar  and 
another  (1972  SCMR  154)  and    Rehmat  Ullah 
and  another  V.  The  Secretary,  Evacuee  Property 
Trust Board, Government of Pakistan, Lahore and 
2 
others 
(1972 
SCMR 
168).  Even                    
the  principle  of  natural  justice  is  equally 
applicable  in  administrative  act  affecting  the 
right  of  a  person,  in  property,  or  status  or 
otherwise  bringing  a  penal  consequences, 
opportunity  to  show  cause  must  be  given. 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
9 
Reliance  in  this  regard  is  placed  on  a  case 
reported    as  Mian  Ghulam  Muhammad  V.  The 
Collector,  Montgomery  and  2  others  (PLD 
1973  Lahore  528).    It has  been  held in  a  case 
reported as Messrs Capital Sports Corporation, 
Sialkot V. Government of Pakistan (1989 MLD 
999)  that  no  party  can  be  condemned  unheard 
on  the  basis  of  inquiry  conducted  behind  his 
back  and  without  his  knowledge,  and  without 
giving him an opportunity of even looking at it 
or rebutting it.  Further reliance is placed in this 
regard  on  a  case  reported  as  Mesrs  Farooq 
International  V.  The  Chief  Controller  of 
Imports  and  Exports  and  4  others  (1985  CLC 
1781). 
12.  It  appears  from  the  record  that  respondent 
No.3 also produced one Muhammad Akram as 
PW-1 who recorded his statement and also got 
exhibited  copy  of  Matriculation  Certificate  as 
Exh.P/2,  copy  of  service  book  Exh.P/3  and 
office  order  dated  09.03.2006  Exh.P/4.  It  will 
not be out of place to mention here that age of 
said  Muhammad  Akram  has  been  recorded  in 
the  matriculation  certificate  as  06.12.1947.  In 
his  service  book  Exh.P/3,  his  date  of  birth 
appears  to  be  tampered  as  06.12.1947.  It 
appears  from  Exh.P/4,  which  is  order  dated 
09.03.2006 
that 
the  petitioner-department 
accepted  the  date  of  birth  of  said  PW-1  as 
06.12.1947  while 
relying 
upon 
his 
Matriculation Certificate. If the date of birth of 
PW-1  could  be  considered  to  be  06.12.1947 
while relying upon his matriculation certificate 
then  why  the  same  treatment  has  not  been 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
10 
given  to  respondent  No.3.  This  is  a  case  of 
clear  discrimination  which  is  violation  of 
Article  25  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
13.  One  objection of  the  petitioner-department 
is  that  earlier  writ  petition  of  respondent  No.3 
filed before this Court was dismissed, therefore, 
grievance petition was not competent. It will be 
pertinent to mention here that said writ petition 
was  dismissed  on  technical  grounds  involving 
factual  controversies  that  the  rules  of  the 
petitioner-department are non-statutory and that 
respondent  No.3  has  not  impleaded  WAPDA 
nor  LESCO  as  party.  However,  in  the  same 
order,  it  was  held  that  respondent  No.3  has 
other  remedies  available  to  him  where  he  can 
agitate the matter and seek relief on the basis of 
evidence produced by him, therefore, objection 
is ill-founded.  
14.  It  has  been  admitted  by  the  petitioner-
department  that  record  of  the  service  book  of 
respondent  No.3  was  in  the  custody  of  the 
department.  If  respondent  No.3  has  tampered 
the  said  record  that  could  not  be  possible 
without  involvement  of  employee  in  whose 
custody  the  records  are  kept  but  no  employee 
has  been  proceeded  by 
the  petitioner-
department  by  initiating  departmental/criminal 
proceedings.  Therefore,  to  say  that  respondent 
No.3  has  tampered  the  record  is  not  tenable. 
Reference  may  be  made  to  the  case  titled  as 
“Collector  of  Customs  and  Central  Excise, 
Peshawar and 2 others v. Abdul Waheed and 7 
others” (2004 SCMR 303), it has been held by 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
11 
the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that 
“competent 
authorities 
should  be 
held 
responsible and liable for the said lapse on their 
part.”  In  another  case  titled  as  “Muhammad 
Akhtar Shirani and others v. Punjab Text Book 
Board  and  others”  (2004  SCMR  1077), 
wherein  it  has  been  held  by  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court of Pakistan that “instead of removing the 
employees from service, action should be taken 
against the authority who wrongly exercised its 
powers.”  Further  reference  may  also  be  made 
to  case  titled  as  “Province  of  Punjab  through 
Secretary,  Agriculture,  Government  of  Punjab 
and others v. Zulfiqar Ali” (2006 SCMR 678), 
wherein  it  has  been  held  by  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  that  “In  other  words  in  such 
like situation instead of taking action against an 
appointee it is appropriate if an action is taken 
against 
the  Appointing  Authority  who 
apparently committed a misconduct by making 
such  appointment.”  Further  reference  may  be 
made  to  the  case  titled  “Abdul  Hafeez  Abbasi 
and  others  v.  Managing  Director,  Pakistan 
International  Airlines  Corporation,  Karachi 
and others” (2002 SCMR 1034), wherein after 
considering facts and circumstances of the case 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as 
under:- 
“Therefore,  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  in  such 
situation  besides  proceedings  against 
the 
beneficiaries of so-called illegal appointments the 
officers  who  were  responsible  for  implementing 
illegal  directives  should  also  be  held  equally 
responsible  and  severe  action  should  be  taken 
against  them  so  in  future  it  may  serve  as  a 
deterrent for other like-minded persons.” 
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
12 
15.  The  other  objection  of  the  petitioner-
department  that  date  of  birth  could  only  be 
changed  within  two  years  from  the  date  of 
joining  is  also  ill-founded  as  respondent  No.3 
had  not  applied  for  change  in  his  date  of  birth 
but 
it  was 
the  petitioner-department  who 
initiated  proceedings  about  the  change  of  date 
of  birth  of  respondent  No.3,  therefore,  the 
reliance  of  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner-
department  upon  Rule  5  of  the  Pakistan 
WAPDA  Employees  (Date  of  Birth)  Rules, 
1994  is  not  applicable  to  the  case  in  hand.  In 
case  reported  as  “Administrative  Committee  of 
High  Court  of  Sindh  through  Registrar,  High 
Court  of  Sindh,  Karachi  and  another  v.  Arjun 
Ram  K.  Talreja  and  another”  (2008  SCMR 
255)  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court of Pakistan that “it is not an absolute rule 
that  once  any  entry  of  date  of  birth  has  been 
made  it  cannot  be  altered  or  changed.”    In 
another  case  reported  as  Ghulam  Hussain  V. 
PB.Labour Appellate Tribunal, etc. (NLR 1991 
Labour 1) it has been held that “it would be in 
consonance  with  the  rule  of  justice  and  equity 
that  the  benefit  of  doubt  in  the  matter  of  age 
should  go  to  the  employee/public  servant  and 
not to the employer/Government. 
16.  No  medical  report  has  been  produced  by 
the petitioner-department qua age of respondent 
No.3.  It  is  simple  medical  test  which  was 
conducted at the time of induction into service 
and  same  has  no  concern  with  the  ossification 
test/date of birth of respondent No.3.  
W.P. No.31576/2015. 
 
 
13 
 
 
17.  The findings of the  learned Punjab Labour 
Court No.1, Lahore and learned Punjab Labour 
Appellate  Tribunal,  Lahore  are  concurrent, 
therefore,  do  not  call  for  any  interference  by 
this Court. This Court cannot interfere into the 
concurrent  findings  of  the  learned  Punjab 
Labour Court No.1, Lahore and learned Punjab 
Labour  Appellate  Tribunal,  Lahore  recorded 
after due assessment of evidence as a Court of 
appeal. Reference may be made to the case law 
reported  as  “Ghulam  Muhammad  and  another 
v. Mst. Noor Bibi and 5 others” (1980  SCMR 
933).  The  relevant  portion  of  the  judgment  is 
reproduced herein below:- 
“we agree with the view taken by the High Court 
that  it  could  not  in  its  limited  constitutional 
Jurisdiction interfere with the concurrent findings 
against  the  petitioner-departments  on  what  was 
essentially a question of fact.”
