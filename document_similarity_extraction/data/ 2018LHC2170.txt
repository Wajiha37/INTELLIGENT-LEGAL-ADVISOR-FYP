the  Anti-Terrorism  Act,  1997  and  section  155-C  of  Police 
Order,  2002  before  Special  Anti-Terrorism  Court,  Lahore, 
challenges  order 
to 
the  extent  of  non-summoning  of 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  passed  by  learned  Judge  ATC-II, 
Lahore dated 07-02-2017. 
2.  
 
The  incident  as  per  the  complaint  (Ex.PA)  took 
place on 16-06-2014 at 01:00 am (midnight) and continued till 
forenoon on 17-06-2014. The District administration of Lahore 
with  the  help  of  police  attempted  to  remove  the  alleged 
illegal  barriers/encroachments  on  public  roads  around 
Minhaj-ul-Quran Academy and its Secretariat in Model Town, 
Lahore,  resulting  in  clash  between  police  and  workers  of 
Pakistan 
Awami 
Tehreek. 
According 
to 
the 
petitioner/complainant,  10  persons  lost  their  lives,  whereas, 
66 
persons 
sustained 
injuries. 
Thereafter, 
the 
petitioner/complainant  went  to  the  Police  Station  Faisal 
Town,  Lahore  and  lodged  a  complaint,  orally.  But  police 
refused  to  lodge  the  FIR.  Rather,  on  the  basis  of  false  and 
concocted story, on the complaint of SHO of the police station 
Faisal  Town,  Lahore  a  case  FIR  No.  510  of  2014 
(Ex.PMMMMMM/1-3)  was  registered  on  17-06-2014,  for 
offences  under  sections  302/34,  324/353,  186/148,  149/290, 
291/427,  506/B,  109  Pakistan  Penal  Code  (Act  XLV  of  1860) 
read  with  Section  7  of  the  ATA  and  under  section  13/20/65 
under  Arms  Ordinance,  1965,  at  police  station  Faisal  Town, 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
3 
 
Lahore against 52 nominated and unknown accused persons, 
who are office bearers and workers of Idara Minhaj-ul-Quran 
and  Pakistan  Awami  Tehreek.  After 
the 
investigation 
conducted  by  JIT,  report  was  filed  against  42  civilians  and 
seven 
police 
officers/officials. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
petitioner/complainant  moved  an  application  under  section 
22-A,  22-B  of  Cr.P.C  (Ex.PNNNNNN/1-7),  for  registration  of 
the second FIR  as per  version of the petitioner/complainant, 
before learned Ex-officio Justice of Peace/ASJ, Lahore on 04-
07-2014.  Vide  order  dated  16-08-2014  (Ex.POOOOOO/4-4) 
learned  Ex-officio  Justice  of  Peace/ASJ,  Lahore  accepted  the 
application  under  section  22-A,  22-B  of  Cr.P.C  and  directed 
to the concerned police to register the FIR on the application 
of the petitioner and then to proceed with investigation under 
the law. The order supra  was  assailed through  constitutional 
petition  No.  22661  of  2014  before  this  Court  by  respondent 
No.  7  etc.,  dismissed  by  this  court  vide  order  dated  26-08-
2014  (Ex.PPPPPPP/1-4).  Thereafter,  FIR  No.  696  of  2014 
(Ex.PQQQQQQ/1-4)  was  registered  on  28-08-2014  and  JIT 
was  constituted  by  the  I.G  Punjab  Mushtaq  Sukhera  to  carry 
out the investigation of the case registered at the petitioner's 
stance.  But  the  members  of  the  JIT  carried  out  dishonest 
investigation of the case because of the nomination of Prime 
Minister  of  Pakistan,  Chief  Minister  Punjab,  Federal  and 
Provincial  Ministers  and  high  ranked  police  officials  being 
accused.  The  JIT  challaned  only  two  police  officials  and  no 
action was taken with regard to principal accused nominated 
in  FIR  No.  696  of  2014  (Ex.PQQQQQQ/1-4).  The  registration 
of  FIR  No.  696  of  2014  was  result  of  sit-in  made  by  Dr. 
Muhammad  Tahir-ul-Qadri.  As  a  result  of  sit-in  and 
negotiation 
the 
government 
promised  with 
the 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
4 
 
petitioner/complainant  and  participants  of  sit-in  that  the 
neutral  JIT  will  be  formed  with  the  consensus.  But  the 
government resiled from its commitment and appointed their 
favorite  officer,  who  earlier  had  earlier  served  under  the 
subordination  at  Gujranwala  and  Lahore,  to  get  favorable 
report.  Thereafter,  Pakistan  Awami  Tehreek  got  registered 
their  protest,  but  the  government  did  not  provide  justice. 
Then, the petitioner/complainant through letter dated 28-12-
2014 asked the I.G Punjab for constitution of neutral JIT, same 
was  ignored.  Till  the  date  of  filing  private  complaint,  the 
petitioner/complainant was trying to get the report of judicial 
commission  through  legal  process,  but  could  not  get  the 
same. Hence, private complaint.  
3.  
 
After  recording  cursory  evidence,  vide  order 
dated  07.02.2017  the  accused-respondent  Nos.13  to  138  in  a 
private complaint were summoned and are facing trial before 
the  ATC,  Lahore.  Vide  the  same  order  dated  07.02.2017  the 
learned  trial  court  opined  that  there  was  no  evidence  to 
prove  prima  facie  case  against  respondent  Nos.1  to  12,  as 
such,  they  were  not  summoned  and  their  names  were 
ordered  to  be  deleted  being  respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  in  the 
private  complaint.  The  impugned  order  dated  07.02.2017  to 
the  extent  of  non-summoning  of  respondent  Nos.1  to  12  is 
under  challenge  by  the  petitioner/complainant  through  the 
instant criminal revision. 
4.  
 
We  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner  and  learned  Prosecutor  General  Punjab  at  length. 
We  have  also  gone  through  the  record  annexed  with  this 
petition  and  the  copies  of  relevant  documents  from  both 
criminal  cases  pending  on  the  file  of  Special  Judge  Anti-
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
5 
 
Terrorism,  Lahore  placed  on  the  record  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioner  through  criminal  miscellaneous 
petitions. 
5.  
 
It  is  an  admitted  position  that  FIR  No.  510  of  2014 
(Ex.PMMMMMM/1-3) was registered on 17-06-2014 at Police 
Station Faisal Town, Lahore on the complaint of Rizwan Qadir 
Hashmi,  Inspector/SHO,  police  station  Faisal  Town,  Lahore. 
As per contents of FIR  No. 510 of 2014 till lodging of the FIR 
seven  (07)  persons  lost  their  lives  and  100  persons  sustain 
injuries.  Whereas, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
written 
complaint/application  dated  19-06-2014  (receipt  of  receiving 
application 
through  dairy  No.  657-5B-FT/19-06-2014  and 
application were placed on the record through C.M. No. 829 of 
2018  at  pages  Nos.  392-A  and  392-B  available  in  volume  No. 
11)  of  the  petitioner/complainant  the  criminal  case  FIR  No. 
696/14,  was  registered  with  Police  Station  Faisal  Town, 
Lahore  on  28-08-2014  and  private  complaint  was  lodged  on 
16-03-2016. 
It 
is 
also 
admitted 
fact 
that 
the 
petitioner/complainant  boycott  the  investigations  conducted 
by two JITs constituted by the government in above said both 
cases.  The  private 
complaint  was 
filed  by 
the 
petitioner/complainant with delay of 21 months from the date 
of occurrence i.e.16/17-06-2014, and finally with delay of six 
months  and  19  days  from  the  date  of  first  submission  of  the 
report  under  section  173  Cr.P.C  in  case  FIR  No.  696/2014 
i.e.27-06-2015. 
6.  
 
Suffice  it  to  point  out  here  that  after  submission  of 
reports under section 173 of Cr.P.C in FIR No. 510 of 2014 till 
14-03-2016  evidence  of  40  prosecution  witnesses  was 
recorded  by 
the 
learned 
trial  court.  Similarly,  after 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
6 
 
submission of reports under section 173 of Cr.P.C in FIR No. 
696  of  2014  till  14-03-2016  evidence  of  21  prosecution 
witnesses  was  recorded  by  the  learned  trial  court  and  the 
cross-examination  upon  the  witnesses  was  reserved  on  the 
request of the defence counsel (appointed by court) and case 
was  adjourned  to  15-03-2016.  Thereafter,  on  15-03-2016,  the 
petitioner/complainant filed a private complaint in the Court 
of  Special  Judge  Anti-Terrorism,  Lahore.  In  this  private 
complaint, 
the  petitioner/complainant  nominated  139 
accused persons, whereas, in FIR No. 696 of 2014 nominated 
23  accused  persons.  In  addition,  the  petitioner/complainant 
has  mentioned  total  number  of  injured  persons  as  66, 
whereas  in  FIR  No.  696  of  2014  mentioned  53  persons  as 
injured persons.  
7.     
Before  proceeding  further  we  may  observe  here 
that  we  are  considering  the  case  only  to  the  extent  of 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12.  According  to  story/roles  in  the 
private complaint related to respondent Nos. 1 to 12 is/are as 
follows:-

The 
story/roles, 
as 
described 
by 
the 
petitioner/complainant  in  the  private  complaint,  is  certainly 
not identical with the story as put up by the prosecution in the 
state  case  i.e.  FIR  No.  696/14.  For  the  purpose  of  present 
revision  petition,  it  is  necessary  to  take  a  note  of  the  roles 
attributed  to  the  respondent  Nos.  1  to  12,  in  the  private 
complaint,  much  different  than  the  state  case.  No  doubt 
private complaint is based on the same incident taken place 
at midnight between 16-06-2014 and 17-06-2014 till forenoon 
on  17-06-2014  (as  per  FIR  No.  696  of  2014  till  10/11  a.m.  on 
17-06-2014).  The  major  details  regarding  the  prosecution 
story to the extent of the roles of respondent Nos. 1 to 12, as 
mentioned  in the private complaint and state case are given 
above,  for  the  purpose  of  decision  of  present  revision 
petition.  
10.    
We have observed that in the State case i.e. FIR No. 
696  of  2014  dated  28-08-2014  the  petitioner/complainant 
impleaded respondent Nos. 1 to 9 as accused but no specific 
role  was  attributed  to  them,  whereas,  respondents  No.  10  to 
12  were  not  impleaded  as  accused. In  the  private  complaint 
respondent  Nos.  10  to  12  have  been  impleaded.  That  has 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
11 
 
been  so,  because  the  petitioner/complainant  with  some 
motive has introduced entirely a new story at the time of the 
filing of the private complaint.  
11.     
The other addition/difference is that in paragraphs 
Nos,  10,  11,  12  and  13  of  the  private  complaint,  some 
additional  allegations  have  been  levelled  in  continuation  of 
the  attempt  to  connect  the  respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  with  the 
incident.  The  learned  Judge  Anti  Terrorism  Court  recorded 
the  cursory  evidence  of 
four  witnesses 
i.e. 
the 
complainant/petitioner  (CW-1),  Muhammad  Shakeel  (CW-
18),  Fiaz  Ahmad  Warriach  (CW-25)  and  Khurram  Nawaz 
Gandapur (CW-56), in this regard under section 200 and 202 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.  
12.    
The  object  of  an  inquiry  under  section  202  of  the 
Code of Criminal Procedure is to ensure that no person shall 
be compelled to answer a criminal charge unless the Court is 
satisfied  that  there  is  a  prima  facie  case  against  him/them. 
The law as  to the  scope and extent of enquiry  under  section 
202  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  is  well  established 
and same is limited to finding out the truth or otherwise of the 
complaint  in  order  to  determine  whether  process  should  be 
issued  or  not. Whereas, section  203  of  the  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure lays down what materials are to be considered for 
the  said  purpose.?  According  to  Section  203  of  the  Code  of 
Criminal  Procedure,  if,  after  considering  the  statements  on 
oath  (if  any)  of  the  complainant  and  of  the  witness  (es)  and 
the result of the inquiry or investigation (if any) under Section 
202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Court is of opinion 
that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding,  he  shall 
dismiss the complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
12 
 
record his reasons for so doing. If, on the contrary, the Court 
taking cognizance of the offence is of the opinion that there is 
sufficient  cause  for  proceeding,  he  should  issue  process 
against  the  accused  in  accordance  with  Section  204  of  the 
Code.  It  may  be  that  the  evidence  which  is  required  to  be 
adduced  by  the  complainant  at  that  stage  may  not  be 
sufficient to record a finding of conviction, but that fact would 
not  absolve  the  complainant  who  wants  Court  to  issue  a 
process  against  the  accused  person  from  leading  some 
credible  evidence  as  may  “prima 
facie”  show 
the 
commission of the offence.  
13.    
 For ready reference section 200, 202, 203 and 204 
of Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 are reproduced below: 
Section 200 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  
 
200.   Examination  of  complainant.  A  Magistrate 
taking  cognizance  of  an  offence  on  complaint 
shall  at  once  examine  the  complainant  upon 
oath,  and  the  substance  of  the  examination 
shall  be  reduced  to  writing  and  shall  be 
signed  by  the  complainant,  and  also  by  the 
Magistrate:  
Provided as follows:  
(a)  when  the  complaint  is  made  in  writing 
nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  deemed  to 
require a Magistrate to examine the complaint 
before transferring the case under section 192 
or sending it to the Court of Sessions.  
(aa)  when  the  complaint  is  made  in  writing 
nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  deemed  to 
require  the  examination  of  a  complainant  in 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
13 
 
any  case  in  which  the  complainant  has  been 
made by a Court or by a public servant acting 
or  purporting  to  act  in  the  discharge  of  his 
official duties:  
(b) * * * * *  
(c)  when the case has been transferred under 
section 192 and the Magistrate so transferring 
it  has  already  examined  the  complainant, 
Magistrate  to  whom  it  is  so  transferred  shall 
not be bound to re-examine the complainant.  
 
Section 202 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  
 
202.   Postponement  of  issue  of  process.  (1)  Any 
Court,  on  receipt  of  a  complaint  of  an  offence 
of which it is authorized to take cognizance, or 
which  has  been  sent  to  it  under  Section  190, 
sub-section  (3),  or  transferred  to  it  under 
Section 191 or Section 192, may, if it thinks fit, 
for reasons to be recorded postpone the issue 
of  process  for  compelling  the  attendance  of 
the  person  complained  against,  and  either 
inquire into the case itself or direct an inquiry 
or  investigation  to  be  made  by  any  Justice  of 
the  Peace  or  by  a  police  officer  or  by  such 
other person as it thinks fit, for the purpose of 
ascertaining  the  truth  or  falsehood  of  the 
complaint.  
Provided  that,  save  where  the  complaint  has 
been made by a Court, no such direction shall 
be  made  unless  the  complainant  has  been 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
14 
 
examined  on  oath  under  the  provisions  of 
Section 200.  
(2)  A  Court  of  Session  may, 
instead  of 
directing an investigation under the provisions 
of  sub-section  (1),  direct  the  investigation  to 
be  made  by  any  Magistrate  subordinate  to  it 
for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  truth  or 
falsehood of the complaint.  
(3)  If  any  inquiry  or  investigation  under  this 
section  is  made  by  a  person  not  being  a 
Magistrate  or  Justice  of  the  Peace  or  a  police-
officer,  such  person  shall  exercise  all  the 
powers  conferred  by  this  Code  on  an  officer-
in-charge  of  a  police-station,  except  that  he 
shall not have power to arrest without warrant.  
(4)  Any  Court  inquiring  into  a  case  under  this 
section  may,  if  it  thinks  fit,  take  evidence  of 
witnesses on oath.  
Section 203 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  
 
203.   Dismissal of complaint. The Court before whom 
a  complaint  is  made  or  to  whom  it  has  been 
transferred or sent  may dismiss the complaint, 
if,  after  considering  the  statement  on  oath  (if 
any)  of  the  complainant  and  the  result  of  the 
investigation  or  inquiry  if  any  under  section 
202  there  is  in  his  judgment  no  sufficient 
ground  for  proceeding.  In  such  case  he  shall 
briefly record his reasons for so doing. 
Section 204 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  
 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
15 
 
204.   Issue of process. (1) If in the opinion of a Court 
taking  cognizance  of  an  offence 
there 
is 
sufficient  ground  for  proceeding  and  the  case 
appears  to  be  one  in  which,  according  to  the 
fourth  column  of 
the  second  schedule  a 
summons  should  issue  in  the  first  instance,  it 
shall  issue  its  summons  for  the  attendance  of 
the  accused.  If  the  case  appears  to  be  one  in 
which,  according  to  that  column,  a  warrant 
should issue in the first instance, it may issue a 
warrant,  or,  if,  it  thinks  fit,  a  summons  for 
causing the accused to be brought or to appear 
at  a  certain  time  before  such  Court  or  if  it  has 
no  jurisdiction  itself  some  other  Court  having 
jurisdiction.  
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to 
affect the provision of section 90.  
(3)  When  by  any  law  for  the  time  being  in 
force  any  process-fees  or  other  fees  are 
payable,  no  process  shall  be  issued  until  the 
fees  are  paid,  and,  if  such  fees  are  not  paid 
within  a  reasonable  time,  the  Court  may 
dismiss the complaint.  
14.    
The scope of inquiry under section 202 of the Code 
of  Criminal  Procedure,  1898  is  extremely  limited  only  to 
ascertain the truth or falsehood of the allegations made in the 
complaint on the materials placed by the complainant before 
the  Court  for  the  limited  purpose  of  finding  out  whether  a 
prima facie case for issue of process has been made out. It is 
true  that  in  coming  to  a  decision  as  to  whether  a  process 
should  be  issued  the  court  can  take  into  consideration 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
16 
 
inherent  improbabilities  appearing  on  the  face  of  the 
complaint  or  in  the  evidence  led  by  the  complainant  in 
support of the allegations but there appears to be a very thin 
line  of  demarcation  between  a  probability  of  conviction  of 
the  accused  and establishment  of  a prima  facie  case  against 
him/them.  The  Court  has  been  given  an  undoubted 
discretion in the matter but the discretion has to be judicially 
exercised  by  him.  Once  the  Court  has  exercised  his 
discretion  it  is  not  for  the  this  Court,  to  substitute  its  own 
discretion  for  that  of  the  Court  or  to  examine  the  case  on 
merits with a view to find out whether or not the allegations in 
the  complaint,  if  proved,  would  ultimately  end  in  conviction 
of the accused. However, it is clear that to decide whether a 
process  should  or  should  not  be  issued,  the  Court  has  to 
consider  whether  the  complaint  discloses  all  the  essential 
ingredients  of  an  offence.  If  the  complaint  does  not  disclose 
any  essential  ingredient  of  the  offence,  that  will  be  a  case 
where the complaint, taken on its face value, does not make 
out any case for issue of a process.  
15.    
Before  proceeding 
further 
it 
is  necessary 
to 
reproduce for ready reference sections 107, 109, 120-A, 120-
B, 503 and 506 of Pakistan Penal Code 1860 below: 
Sec.107 PPC  
107. Abetment of a thing. A person abets the doing of a 
thing, who: 
 
First.  
Instigates  any  person  to  do  that  thing; 
or 
  
 
Secondly.  Engages  with  one  or  more  other 
person  or  persons  in  any  conspiracy 
for  the  doing  of  that  thing,  if  an  act  or 
illegal  omission 
takes  place 
in 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
17 
 
pursuance  of  that  conspiracy,  and  in 
order to the doing of that thing; or  
Thirdly.  
Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal 
omission, the doing of that thing.  
Explanation 1.  A  person  who,  by  willful 
misrepresentation, 
or  by  willful 
concealment  of  a  material  fact  which 
he  is  bound  to  disclose,  voluntarily 
causes  or  procures,  or  attempts  to 
cause or procure, a thing to be done, is 
said to instigate the doing of that thing.  
Illustration.  1.  A  public  officer,  is  authorized  by  a 
warrant  from  a  Court  of  Justice  to 
apprehend Z.  B,  knowing  that  fact  and 
also that C is not Z, willfully represents 
to  A 
that  C 
is  Z,  and 
thereby 
intentionally causes A to apprehend C. 
Here  B  abets  by 
instigation 
the 
apprehension of C.  
Explanation  2.Whoever,  either  prior  to  or  at  the 
time of the commission of an act, does 
anything 
in  order  to 
facilitate  the 
commission  of  that  act,  and  thereby 
facilitate  the  commission  thereof,  is 
said to aid the doing of that act. 
Sec.109 PPC  
  109.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  the  act  abetted  is 
committed 
in  consequence,  and  where  no 
express  provision  is  made  for  its  punishment. 
Whoever  abets  any  offence  shall,  if  the  act 
abetted  is  committed  in  consequence  of  the 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
18 
 
abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by 
this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment, 
be  punished  with  the  punishment  provided  for 
the offence. 
Provided  that,  except  in  case  of  Ikrah-i-Tam  the 
abettor  of  an  offence  referred  to  in  Chapter  XVI 
shall be liable to punishment of ta’zir specified for 
such offence including death.  
Explanation:  An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be 
committed 
in 
consequence  of 
abetment,  when  it  is  committed  in 
consequence of the instigation or in 
pursuance of the conspiracy, or with 
the  aid,  which  constitutes 
the 
abetment. 
Illustrations  (a)      A  offers  a  bribe  to  B,  a  public 
servant,  as  a  reward  for  showing  A 
some  favour  in  the  exercise  of  B’s 
official 
functions.  B  accepts 
the 
bribe.  A  has  abetted  the  offence 
defined in section 161.  
(b)  A 
instigates  B 
to  give 
false 
evidence.  B,  in  consequence  of  the 
instigation  commits  that  offence.  A 
is  guilty  of  abetting  that  offence, 
and 
is 
liable 
to 
the 
same 
punishment as B.  
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in 
pursuance  of 
the  conspiracy, 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
19 
 
procures the poison and delivers it 
to  B 
in  order 
that  he  may 
administer  it  to  Z.  B,  in  pursuance 
of  the  conspiracy,  administers  the 
poison  to  Z  in  A's  absence  and 
thereby causes Z’s death. Here B is 
guilty  of  murder.  A  is  guilty  of 
abetting 
that 
offence 
by 
conspiracy,  and  is  liable  to  the 
punishment for murder.  
Sec.120-A PPC  
 
  120A. 
Definition of criminal conspiracy.  
When two or more persons agree to do, or cause 
to be done,  
(1) an illegal act, or  
(2)  an  act  which  is  not  illegal  by  illegal  means, 
such  an  agreement  is  designated  a  criminal 
conspiracy:  
Provided that no agreement except an agreement 
to  commit  an  offence  shall  amount  to  a  criminal 
conspiracy  unless 
some  act  besides 
the 
agreement is done by one or more parties to such 
agreement in pursuance thereof.  
Explanation.-It  is  immaterial  whether  the  illegal 
act is the ultimate object of such agreement, or is 
merely incidental to that object.  
 
Sec.120-B PPC 
  120-B. Punishment of criminal conspiracy  
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
20 
 
(1)   Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy 
to commit an offence punishable with death, 
2[imprisonment 
for 
life]  or 
rigorous 
imprisonment  for  a  term  of  two  years  or 
upwards  shall,  where  no  express  provision 
is  made  in  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of 
such a conspiracy, be punished in the same 
manner as if he had abetted such offence. 
(2)   Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy 
other  than  a  criminal  conspiracy  to  commit 
an  offence  punishable  as  aforesaid  shall  be 
punished  with 
imprisonment  of  either 
description  for  a  term  not  exceeding  six 
months, or with fine or with both. 
Sec.503 PPC 
  503. Criminal intimidation.  
Whoever  threatens  another  with  any  injury 
to  his  person,  reputation  or  property,  or  to 
the person or reputation of anyone in whom 
that person is interested, with intent to cause 
alarm to that person, or to cause that person 
to  do  any  act  which  he  is  not  legally  bound 
to  do,  or  to  omit  to  do  any  act  which  that 
person is legally entitled to do, as the means 
of  avoiding  the  execution  of  such  threat, 
commits criminal intimidation.  
Explanation.-A  threat  to  injure  the  reputation  of 
any  deceased  person  in  whom  the 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
21 
 
person  threatened  is  interested,  is 
within this section.  
Illustration A,  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  B  to 
desist  from  prosecuting  a  civil  suit, 
threatens to burn B’s house. A is guilty 
of criminal intimidation.  
Sec.506 PPC 
506. Punishment for criminal intimidation.  
Whoever  commits 
the  offence  of  criminal 
intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment 
of either description for a term which may extend 
to two years, or with fine, or with both;  
If  threat  be  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  etc. 
and  if  the  threat  be  to  cause  death  or  grievous 
hurt,  or  to  cause  the  destruction  of  any  property 
by  fire,  or  to  cause  an  offence  punishable  with 
death  or 
imprisonment 
for 
life,  or  with 
imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to 
seven  years,  or  to  impute  unchastity  to  a  woman, 
shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either 
description for a term which may extend to seven 
years, or with fine, or with both.  
16.    
There  being  no  presumption  arising  out  of  the 
above  said  contents  of  the  private  complaint  against  the 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  for  the  commission  of  criminal 
conspiracy,  abetment  and  criminal 
intimidation  of 
the 
occurrence.  It  is  beyond  the  pale  of  controversy,  that  the 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  could  not  be  proceeded  against, 
without  the  petitioner/complainant  having  made  a  prima 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
22 
 
facie  case  against them, that they  hatched  up  conspiracy  for 
commission of this occurrence. At least, what is alleged in the 
private complaint and by the complainant and  witnesses got 
in their cursory statements are not in line with the contents of 
written  complaint/application  dated  19-06-2014. 
It 
is 
admitted  fact  that  the  petitioner/complainant  submitted 
written  complaint/application  dated  19-06-2014  (written 
complaint/application was  placed  on the  record  through  C.M. 
No. 829 of 2018 at page No. 392-B available in volume No. 11) 
before the S.H.O. police station Faisal Town, Lahore, after two 
days 
of 
the 
occurrence. 
The 
belated  written 
complaint/application  was  totally  silent  about  the  three  (3) 
meetings allegedly held on 15-06-2014 and 16-06-2014. Even 
we  observed  that  as  none  of  the  above  said  witnesses  i.e. 
Fiaz  Ahmad  Warriach 
(CW-25)  and  Khurram  Nawaz 
Gandapur  (CW-56)  had  stated  anything  regarding  the  fact 
that  on  15-06-2014  on  their  return  after  attending  meeting 
with  respondent  Nos.  1  to  10  they  informed  about  the 
conversation/threats issued by the respondent Nos. 1 to 10 to 
the 
complainant/petitioner 
(CW-1). 
The 
complainant/petitioner  (CW-1)  also  had  not  uttered  a  single 
word  that  when  and  how  he  came  to  know  about  the 
conversation  between  Fiaz  Ahmad  Warriach  (CW-25), 
Khurram Nawaz Gandapur (CW-56) and respondent Nos. 1 to 
10 nor he (the petitioner/complainant) mentioned this fact in 
the private complaint. 
17.    
The  allegations  leveled  in  the  private  complaint 
are  not  based  on  direct  knowledge  derived  from  any 
individual  but  on  conjectures  and  presumptions.  Evidently, 
conscious of the fact that the respondent Nos. 1 to 12 are not 
responsible  for  offence,  the  complainant  has  sought  aid  of 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
23 
 
sections  109,  120-B  and  506  PPC.  But,  again 
the 
petitioner/complainant  could  not  allege  necessary  facts  to 
show  prior  meeting  of  minds  of  the  accused,  essential  to 
make  out  a  case  of  common  intention  or  participation  of  the 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  in  any  abetment  and  criminal 
conspiracy.  The  allegations  do  not  also  make  out  a  case  of 
abetment, criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation. It is 
not  a  case  of  mere  embellishment;  it  is  an  afterthought  plea 
advanced  by  the  petitioner/complainant  and  is  based  on 
motivation. The petitioner/complainant had not mentioned in 
the 
written 
complaint/application 
(written 
complaint/application was  placed  on the  record  through  C.M. 
No. 829 of 2018 at page No. 392-B available in volume No. 11) 
submitted  before  the  S.H.O.  police  station  Faisal  Town, 
Lahore  on  19-06-2014  that  Khurram  Nawaz  Gandapur  (CW-
56)  was  also  with  at 
the 
time  of  occurrence.  The 
petitioner/complainant  mentioned 
in 
the 
written 
complaint/application  dated  19-06-2014  and  FIR  No. 
696/2014  that  he  along  with  Hafiz  Muhammad  Waqar  and 
Muhammad Tayyab Zia was present at Minhaj-ul-Quran, 365-
M  Model  Town,  Lahore.  They  came  outside  after  hearing 
noise  and  witnessed  that  Rana  Abdul  Jabbar  DIG  Operation, 
Tariq  Aziz  S.P.  Model  Town  along  with  a  large  number  of 
police  personnel  armed  with 
firearm  weapons,  crane, 
bulldozers  and  loader  trucks  were  gathering  around  the 
residence of Dr. Muhammad Tahir-Ul-Qadri No.299-M Model 
Town,  Lahore.  On  his  (the  petitioner/complainant)  asking 
DIG replied as under: -

However,  the  petitioner/complainant  (CW-1)  in  his  cursory 
statement stated as under:- 
"I along with Khurram Nawaz Ganda Pur, Hafiz 
Muhammad Waqar s/o Muhammad Ashraf and 
Tayyab Zia Norani s/o Mumtaz Ahmad went to 
police  officers  mentioned  above  and  made 
known  to  them  that  the  barriers  outside  Idara 
Minahaj-ul-Quran  and 
residence  of  Dr. 
Muhammad  Tahir-ul-Qadri  were  installed  by 
the  local  police  under  the  orders  of  Hon'ble 
Lahore High Court, Lahore in respond whereof 
said  police  officers  stated  that  they  stood 
ordered  by  Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz  Shrif, 
Mian  Shehbaz  Sharif,  Ch.  Nisar  Ali  Khan, 
Khawaja  Saad  Rafiq  and  Rana  Sana  Ullah  to 
cause  the  removal  of  barriers  as  well  as 
hurdles from M-Block Model Town, Lahore by 
all means and to eliminate the family members 
of  Dr.  Muhammad  Tahir-Ul-Qadri  as  well  as 
their 
followers 
in 
case  of 
resistance 
whereupon 
I  along  with  my  companions 
mentioned above protested.”  
18.    
However,  from  the  cursory  statement  of  Khurram 
Nawaz  Gandapur  (CW-56)  it  reveals  that  he  (CW-56)  was 
present  at  the  time  of  occurrence,  but  he  did  not  utter  a 
single  word  that  he  informed  about  the  meeting  held  on  15-
06-2014  after  maghrib  prayer  to  the  petitioner/complainant 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
25 
 
before  the  occurrence  or  soon  after  the  occurrence.  This 
creates  doubt  regarding  the  authenticity  of  the  allegations 
leveled  by  Faiz  Ahmad  Warriach  (CW-25)  and  Khurram 
Nawaz  Gandapur  (CW-56).  As  the  petitioner/complainant 
came 
forward  with  his  version 
in  writing 
through 
complaint/application 
dated 
19-06-2014 
(written 
complaint/application was  placed  on the  record  through  C.M. 
No. 829 of 2018 at page No. 392-B available in volume No. 11)  
wherein presence of Khurram Nawaz Gandapur (CW-56) and 
any  conversation  taken  place  in  between  Khurram  Nawaz 
Gandapur (CW-56) and police officers in the presence of the 
petitioner/complainant was not mentioned.  
19.    
On  the  other  hand,  the  petitioner/complainant  has 
specifically  mentioned  in  the  private  complaint  that  soon 
after the occurrence he orally lodged complaint to the S.H.O. 
of concerned police station. But the case FIR No. 510 of 2014 
was lodged on the complaint of S.H.O of police station Faisal 
Town,  Lahore.  This  fact  is  contrary  to  the  contents  of  written 
complaint/application  dated  19-06-2014  and  FIR  No. 
696/2014  wherein 
the  petitioner/complainant  had  not 
mentioned  that  earlier  he  (the  petitioner/complainant)  had 
made  oral  complaint  regarding  the  occurrence  to  SHO  of 
concerned  police  station,  but  his  statement  was  not 
recorded. It will be relevant to mention  here  that, this  is  not 
the  case  of  the  petitioner/complainant  that  above  said 
application was not moved by him or  the contents of the FIR 
No. 696/2014 were not in line with the contents of above said 
application/complaint.  Relevant  portion  of  the  FIR  No. 
696/2014 at the cost of repetition is reproduced below:

20.    
It  is  not  a  case  of  mere  exaggeration,  rather,  the 
plea now advanced is clearly an afterthought to the extent of 
respondent  Nos.  1  to  12.  Interestingly,  in  the  written 
complaint/application  for  registration  of  case  dated  19-06-
2014, no definite roles are ascribed to the respondent Nos. 1 
to 9  and respondent Nos.  10 to 12  have not been arrayed as 
accused for hatching up conspiracy/abetment.  
21.    
In  the  absence  of  the  existence  of  ingredients  to 
constitute 
the  alleged  offence  of  criminal  conspiracy, 
abetment  and  criminal  intimidation,  we  are  of  the  opinion 
that  proceeding  against  the  respondent  Nos.  1  to  12  on  the 
basis  of such  complaint  would  be  abuse  of  process  of  court. 
We are of the opinion that the respondent Nos. 1 to 12 cannot 
summoned by invoking section 120-B or section 109 and 506 
PPC. The words allegedly stated by the respondent Nos.1 to 
10  during  the  meeting  held  on  15-06-2014  do  not  constitute 
commission  of  offence  of  criminal  conspiracy,  abetment  and 
criminal  intimidation.  The  petitioner/complainant  miserably 
failed 
to  prove 
the  prima-facie  existence  of 
factual 
ingredients  constituting  the  offence  falling  under  sections 
107, 120-A and 503 PPC. 
22.  
Though,  the  petitioner/complainant  boycott  the 
investigations  conducted  by  the  two  JITs  formed  in  above 
said two cases as well as proceedings of one man tribunal of 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
27 
 
inquiry  constituted  on  17-06-2014  by  the  Honorable  Chief 
Justice  of  Lahore  High  Court  on 
the  request  of 
the 
Government  of  the  Punjab  for  inquiry  and  to  ascertain  the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  the  incident  at  Minhaj-ul-Quran 
Academy  and  Secretariat  in  Model  Town,  Lahore.  But  it  is 
admitted  fact  that  the  one  man  tribunal  of  inquiry  submitted 
report with the competent Authority on 09-08-2014, whereas 
FIR  was  lodged  on  28-08-2014.  Wherein,  any  information 
given by Muhammad Shakeel son of Abdul Rasheed (CW-18) 
to  the  petitioner/complainant  about  the  alleged  confession 
made  by  the  respondent  Nos.  4,  9  to  12  was  not  mentioned 
nor  in  the  private  complaint  it  was  mentioned  by  the 
complainant/petitioner 
(CW-1) 
that  when  Muhammad 
Shakeel  son  of  Abdul  Rasheed  (CW-18)  and  Mahboob 
Hussain  Ch.  Advocate  High  Court 
informed  him  (the 
petitioner)  about  the  alleged  confession  made  by  the 
respondent Nos. 4, 9 to 12. Besides, Muhammad Shakeel son 
of  Abdul  Rasheed  (CW-18)  in  his  cursory  statement  has  not 
mentioned that when and where he heard alleged confession 
made  by  the  respondent  Nos.  4,  9  to  12  and  when  he 
informed  the  petitioner/complainant  about  said  alleged 
confession.  Even  otherwise  the  statement  made  by  any 
person  before  the  commission  of  Inquiry  is  inadmissible  in 
evidence  in  any  future  proceedings,  civil  or  criminal.  For 
ready  reference  section  6  of  the  Punjab  Tribunals  of  Inquiry 
Ordinance, 1969 are reproduced hereunder: 
6.  Statements made by persons to the Tribunal: 
  No statement made by a person in the course of giving 
evidence before the Tribunal shall subject him to, or be 
used  against  him  in,  any  civil  or  criminal  proceedings 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
28 
 
except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such 
statement:  
  Provided that the statement:  
(a) is made in reply to a question which he is required by 
the Tribunal to answer; or  
(b) is relevant to the subject matter of inquiry.  
23.    
Besides, at no point of time, till registration of case, 
it  was  the  version  of  the  petitioner/complainant  that  he  also 
attended the meeting chaired by Rana Sana Ullah. Even in the 
private  complaint 
the  petitioner/complainant  had  not 
mentioned that he also attended the meeting chaired by Rana 
Sana  Ullah  on  16-06-2014.  However,  during  cursory 
statement  the  petitioner/complainant  (CW-1)  stated  that  he 
attended  the  meeting  chaired  by  Rana  Sana  Ullah  on  16-06-
2014. The following excerpt of his cursory statement reads as 
under:- 
"On  16.06.2014,  a  special  meeting  was 
convened under the chair of Rana Sana Ullah 
Minister  which  was  attended  by 
the 
complaint  against  respondents  No.10  to  16 
and  18  wherein  the  planning  was  made  to 
implement  the  decision  having  been  taken 
by  Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz  Sharif,  Shehbaz 
Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz and others regarding 
the  arrival  of  Dr. Muhammad  Tahir-ul-Qadri 
and  it  was  unanimously  resolved  that  the 
Government  officials  would  visit  M-Block 
Model  Town,  Lahore  under  the  garb  of 
removing  barriers  and  would 
launch  a 
massive  attack  on  Idara  Minhaj-ul-Quran 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
29 
 
and  whosoever  would  cause  hurdle 
to 
achieve  the  aforesaid  object  he  would  be 
crushed.”   
24.    
The  petitioner/complainant  has  not  uttered  even  a 
single  word  in  his  cursory  statement  about  the  contents 
published  in  different  news  papers  on  05-05-2014,  01-06-
2014, 02-06-2014, 03-06-2014, 06-06-2014, 09-06-2014 and 19-
06-2014. The alleged statements of the respondent Nos. 4 and 
5  are  averred  in  para  No.  9  of  the  private  complaint,  at  the 
cost of repetition same is reproduced herein below:

Even, the complainant/petitioner (CW-1)  had not mentioned 
above 
said 
facts 
in 
the 
FIR.  Although, 
the 
petitioner/complainant  reported  the  occurrence  through 
written  application/complaint  after 
two  days  of 
the 
occurrence.  
25.    
The claimed media reports are not part of  the FIR, 
although the written complaint/application for registration of 
case  was  submitted  on  19-06-2014.  It  is  settled  law  that  the 
news papers cuttings or video recording of the statements of 
accused, has to be proved by the author or creator and none 
of the author or creator was named as witness in the calendar 
of  the  witnesses.  No  date,  time,  name  of  the  program  aired,

names  of  the  channels  flash  above  said  alleged  statements 
and the names of the channels recorded above said alleged 
statements  accept  Minhaj  TV  had  been  mentioned  in  the 
private  complaint  as  well  as  stated  by  Kashif  Saeed  son  of 
Muhammad  Saeed  (CW-53) 
in  his  cursory  statement. 
Relevant part of deposition is re-produced herein below:- 
"In  retaliation  of  the  pronouncement  of  the 
Dr.  Muhammad  Tahir  Ul  Qadri,  Rana  Sana 
Ullah  provincial  Minister  and 
federal 
Minister  Khawaja  Saad  Rafique  replied  and 
loudly  pronounced  that  if  Dr.  Muhammad 
Tahir  Ul  Qadri  shall  come  to  Pakistan  then 
his “giant” (Jinn) shall be removed and they 
have  prepared  “DHOONI”  which  shall  be 
given  to  him.  This  replies  of  Rana  Sana 
Ullah and Khawaja Saad Rafique was flashed 
in  the  media  and  it  was  also  recorded  by 
the  different  TV  channels  along  Minhaj  TV 
and I prepared the CD from the same and it 
presented  before  this  court  which  is  P.7 
which  is  true  and  original  copy  of  the 
statements  of Rana  Sana  Ullah  and  Khawaja 
Saad  Rafique.  ----------------  On  15.06.2014 
Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz  Sharif  and  Mian 
Muhammad  Shahbaz  Sharif  meet  at  Jati 
Umra  Raiwind  Lahore  and  they  discussed 
the arrival of Dr. Muhammad Tahir Ul Qadri 
in  Pakistan 
to  agitate  against 
their 
governments  which  was  also  flashed  in  the 
electronic and print media.” 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
31 
 
No  authenticity  to  the  newspapers  cuttings  could  be  given. 
Reliance  is  placed  on  the  judgment  of  the  Honorable 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  titled,  "Malik  Muhammad 
Mumtaz  Qadri  versus  The  State  and  others"  reported  as 
PLD 2016 Supreme Court 17.  
26.    
The petitioner/complainant had also not mentioned 
specific  date,  time  and  name  of  the  aircraft,  which  was 
diverted  to  Lahore  Airport  from  Islamabad  in  the  private 
complaint nor stated in his statement made on oath as CW-1. 
Even the petitioner/complainant had  not  mentioned a single 
word  in  this  regard  in  the  FIR  No.696/14  dated  28-08-2014. 
Relevant  part  of  deposition  of  the  petitioner/complainant 
(CW-1) is as follows:- 
"The 
aforementioned 
conspiracy 
and 
abetment  on  the  part  of  Prime  Minister  of 
Pakistan,  Chief  Minister  and  others 
is 
reflected from the fact that the aircraft of Dr. 
Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was not allowed 
to be landed at Islamabad airport rather the 
same  was  diverted  to  Lahore  Airport  and 
the  aforesaid  act  on 
the  part  of 
the 
government  has  not  yet  been  justified.  The 
clips  of  daily  newspapers  are  also  made 
available  on the file in support of aforesaid 
contention.” 
That the statement of the petitioner/complainant (CW-1) does 
not disclose the ingredients essential for criminal conspiracy 
and  abetment.  The  petitioner/complainant  (CW-1)  had  not 
stated in his statement that any complaint was lodged by any 
of  the  passengers  or  members  of  crew  of  the  aircraft.  Thus 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
32 
 
the  rule  of  "res  gesta"  in  terms  of  provisions  of  Article  19  of 
Qaunu-e-Shahadat is also not attracted in the instant case. 
27.    
In  above  said  circumstances,  the  order  of  non-
summoning the respondent Nos. 1 to 12, does not suffer from 
any illegality as learned Judge ATC-II, Lahore has examined 
all the witnesses which the petitioner/complainant desired to 
produce  and  intended  to  rely  upon.  There  has  thus  been 
substantial  compliance  of  the  provisions  of  Section  202  of 
Cr.P.C.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  also  stated  at  the 
bar  that  the  complainant  relied  upon  the  evidence  of 
witnesses produced and that he did not desire to produce or 
examine  any  other  witness.  It  is,  thus,  quite  evident  that 
learned  Judge  ATC-II,  Lahore  recoded  the  witnesses  which 
the petitioner/complainant desired to produce and intended 
to  rely  upon and  thus  there  was  compliance  of  provisions  of 
Section  202  Cr.P.C.  The  allegations  averred  in  the  private 
complaint  and  stated  by  the  witnesses  i.e.  Muhammad 
Shakeel  (CW-18),  Ahmad  Warriach  (CW-25),  Kashif  Saeed 
(CW-53)  and  Khurram  Nawaz  Gandapur  (CW-56)  included 
petitioner/complainant  (CW-1)  on  oath  were  found  to  be 
afterthought  and  does  not  disclose  essential  ingredients  for 
constituting the offences punishable under section 409, 120-B 
and  506  PPC.  Thus,  issuance  of  process  would  require 
availability of proof in terms of Articles 117, 118, 119 and 121 
of  the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984.  It  may  not  be  proper 
for this Court to enter into reasoning for non-summoning the 
respondent Nos. 1 to 12 as accused at this point of time when 
no allegation is made against the respondent Nos 1 to 12 and 
proceeding  against  the  respondent  Nos  1  to  12  on  the  basis 
of such complaint would be abuse of process of court. So,  in 
the  present  case,  in  above  said  circumstances,  the  matter 
Criminal Revision No.9027 of 2017 
33 
 
cannot remanded to the learned trial court for the purpose of 
further enquiry in specified manner. Considering the manner 
in  which  the  case  has  been  set  up,  the  inconsistent  stand 
taken  by  the  petitioner/complainant,  it  is  found  that  the 
learned  Judge  Anti-Terrorism  Court  have  applied  his  mind 
while recording order of non-summoning respondent Nos. 1 
to  12  as  accused  and,  therefore,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the 
reasoning given for non summoning respondent Nos. 1 to 12 
as  accused  by  the  learned  Judge  Anti-Terrorism  Court  is 
illegal and perverse. We may observe that the order passed 
under  section  204,  Cr.P.C.,  is  not  a  judgment  and  can  be 
reviewed  by  the  Court,  seized  with  the  matter,  if  some 
incriminating  material  is  brought  on  the  file  during  trial. 
Admittedly,  the  Court  takes  cognizance  of  the  case  as  a 
whole and not regarding some of the accused, thus, the Court 
was  not  debarred  to  summon  a  person  to  face  trial  if 
convincing incriminating material is brought on the file. The 
provisions  of  section  540,  Cr.P.C.,  can  also  be  pressed  into 
service, during trial, if fresh incriminating material comes to 
the knowledge of the complainant. Reliance is placed on the 
cases  reported  as  “Raja  Khush  Bakhtur  Rehman  and 
another versus The State” (1985 SCMR 1314), “Muhammad 
Sharif  versus The State and another” (1995 SCMR 894) and 
“Iqbal  Hussain  Shah  and  another    versus  The  State and  3 
others”  (2012  PCr.L.J  848).  When  the  reasoning  given  for 
non-summoning  is  not  found  to  be  illegal  and  perverse,  it 
would  not  be  open  for  this  Court  to  interfere  with  the  said 
findings  while  exercising  revisional  jurisdiction.  There  is  no 
merit in this revision petition and it is dismissed accordingly.
