Through  instant  petition  under  Section  498 
Cr.P.C.  petitioner  Muhammad  Kaleem  has  sought 
the premium of bail before arrest in case FIR No.22, 
dated  09.02.2013,  in  respect  of  offences  under 
Sections 462-B, 462-F, 379 & 411 PPC registered 
at Police Station Umar-Kot, District Rajanpur.  
2. 
The brief allegation, as contained in the crime 
report,  is  that  on  06.02.2013  at  11:00  a.m. 
Supervisor  Control  Staff  Hamid  Mehmood  had 
furnished  information  regarding  the  droppage  of 
pressure  in  PARCO  pipeline  Burji  No.500/50 
(Section-III)  at  3:00  a.m.  that  some  unknown 
accused persons, after connecting iron clump with 
main pipeline, had stolen oil in six canes measuring 
30-liters each, which were concealed by them at the 
distance  of  500-meter  from  the  said  point.    The 
matter  was  reported  to  the  police  who  had  visited 
the  spot,  summoned  Mirza  Muhammad  Ijaz, 
Engineer  and  changed  the  said  iron  clump  with 
safety  clump.    It  was  alleged  that  as  per  reliable 
sources the petitioner alongwith four nominated and 
Crl. Misc. No.2201-B/2018

5/6 unknown accused persons were involved in the said theft. Hence, 
this case was registered.  
3. 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General appearing for the State assisted by learned 
counsel for the complainant and have perused the record.  
4. 
The petitioner alongwith his co-accused has been implicated in 
this case merely on the basis of spy information and on suspicion.  On 
Courtâ€™s query, Deputy Prosecutor General appearing for the State after 
page-to-page  search  remained  fail  to  show  any  piece  of  evidence 
regarding involvement of the petitioner in this case and has gracefully 
conceded  that  the  prosecution  has  no  piece  of  evidence  against  the 
petitioner except suspicion because of his previous history of such like 
cases.    The  suspicion  how  much  strong  is  always  suspicion,  which 
cannot take the place of legal proof.  It has been pointed out that the 
petitioner  was  previously  convicted  in  case  FIR  No.214  dated 
29.10.2012, in respect of offences under Sections 462-B, 462-F, 379 & 
411 PPC registered at Police Station Umar-Kot, District Rajanpur and 
sentenced to the imprisonment of seven years by the learned Magistrate 
Section-30,  Rajanpur  vide  judgment  dated  02.11.2016,  which  was 
upheld by the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 
09.02.2017.   To meet with the point, learned counsel for the petitioner 
has  submitted  the  attested  photocopy  of  Crl.Misc.No.3/2017  in 
Crl.Rev.No.39/2017 wherein the sentence of the petitioner has already 
been  suspended  by  this  Court  on  19.12.2017  and  the  main  criminal 
revision  against  the  conviction  and  sentence  of  the  petitioner  is  still 
pending  adjudication.    In  the  given  circumstances,  the  previous 
conviction and sentence has no bearing upon confirmation of the bail 
before arrest of the petitioner especially when he is otherwise entitled 
for  the  said  relief  as  the  appeal/revision  against  conviction  is  the 
continuation of the trial.  The implication of the petitioner in the alleged 
occurrence  seems  to  be  tainted  with  malafide  intention  and  some 
ulterior motives on the part of the complainant.  The insistence of the 
investigating  agency  upon  arrest  of  the  petitioner  is  apparently 
unnecessary and, thus, smacking of bad faith.

pre-arrest  bail  already  granted  to  the  petitioner  is  hereby  confirmed 
subject to his furnishing fresh bail bonds in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- 
(rupees one lac) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction 
of the trial Court.
