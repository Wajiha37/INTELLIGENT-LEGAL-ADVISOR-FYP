Ayesha  A.  Malik  J:  This  single  judgment  decides  upon  the  issues 
raised  in  the  instant  petition  as  well  as  connected  WP  Nos.154849  and 
160181 of 2018 as common question of law and facts are involved in these 
petitions. 
2. 
The  Petitioners  in  all  the  petitions  are  members  of  the  Cooperative 
Model  Town  Society  (“Society”)  and  some  have  served  on  the  Managing 
Committee  (“M.C”)  of  the  Society.  A  dispute  has  arisen  between  the 
Petitioners  and  the  Society  with  reference  to  the  upcoming  2018  elections 
for  the  MC  of  the  Society.  In  the  instant  case,  objection  was  raised  by 
Respondent No.6 before the Election Sub-Committee (“ESC”) with respect 
to  the  membership  of  the  Petitioners.  The  ESC  heard  the  objection  and 
passed  order  dated  24.01.2018  whereby  the  names  of  the  Petitioners  were 
directed to be deleted from the voter list. The reason given in the order was 
that  the  Petitioners  were  not  the  original  allottees  of  the  settlement 
WP No.156887/2018

department and are subsequent purchasers, hence, their membership is hit by 
clause  13  (i)  and  (ii)  of  the  Bye  Laws  of  the  Cooperative  Model  Town 
Society (1962) Limited, Lahore (“the Byelaws”), meaning thereby that they 
cannot  be  members  of  the  Society  and  their  names  were  directed  to  be 
deleted  from  the  voters  list  of  the  Society.  The  Petitioners  filed  a  revision 
petition  before  the  Secretary  Cooperative,  who  passed  order  dated 
25.01.2018 suspending the order of ESC dated 24.01.2018. Against the order 
of 25.01.2018 Respondent No.6, Arif Majeed filed WP No.154849/2018 on 
the  ground  that  the  Secretary  Cooperative  did  not  have  jurisdiction  as  an 
appeal  against  the  order  of  ESC  lies  before  the  Registrar  Cooperative  and 
not  before  the  Secretary  Cooperative.  The  order  of  25.01.2018  was 
suspended  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated  29.01.2018  passed  in  WP 
No.154849/2018.  The  Petitioners  in  the  instant  petition  withdrew  the 
revision  petition  filed  before  the  Secretary  Cooperative  and  filed  a  petition 
under  Section  64-A  of  the  Cooperative  Societies  Act,  1925  (“Act”)  before 
the  Registrar  Cooperative,  who  vide  order  dated  30.01.2108  declined  to 
interfere  in  the  matter  on  account  of  the  pendency  of  the  present  petitions 
before  this  Court.  The  said  order  was  impugned  before  the  Secretary 
Cooperative  on  the  same  day  who  also  declined  to  interfere  on  the  same 
ground  vide  order  dated  30.01.2018.  Both  these  orders  of  24.01.2018  and 
30.01.2018 have been impugned in the instant petition along with the order 
dated 24.01.2018 of ESC.  
3. 
The  Petitioner  in  WP  No.154849/2018  is  a  member  of  the  society, 
who 
is  aggrieved  by 
the  participation  of 
the  Petitioners  of  WP 
No.156887/2018  in  the  upcoming  election  on  the  ground  that  they  do  not 
qualify as members of the Society and therefore, cannot contest the election. 
The Petitioner, Arif Majeed filed WP No.154849/2018 challenging the order 
of  25.01.2018  passed  by  the  Secretary  Cooperative,  however, subsequently 
since  the  revision  petition  pending  before  the  Secretary  Cooperative  was 
withdrawn  as  such  the  prayer  to  the  extent  of  the  impugned  order  has 
become  infructuous.  The  Petitioner  also  questions  the  participation  of 
WP No.156887/2018 
3 
Respondents  No.6  and  7  (Petitioners  in  WP  No.156887/2018)  in  the 
election. 
4. 
The  Petitioners  of  WP  No.160181/2018  are  members  of  the  Society, 
who have actively taken part in the affairs of the Society. They are desirous 
to contest the upcoming election of the Society. However, their names have 
also  been  deleted  from  the  voters  list  by  ESC  on  the  basis  of  some 
objections.  They  are  aggrieved  by  orders  dated  24.01.2018  and  30.01.2018 
passed by Respondents No.1 to 3 whereby the names of the Petitioners were 
directed to be deleted from the voters list.  
5. 
Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the order of ESC failed to take 
into  consideration  the  fact  that  both  the  Petitioners  are  members  of  the 
Society  since  long  and  that  they  have  contested  and  participated  in  the 
previous elections for the Managing Committee. That the ESC does not have 
jurisdiction to terminate or expel any member of the Society as a member of 
the  Society  enjoys  substantive  rights  which  cannot  be  adjudicated  upon  by 
the ESC. Further that the election schedule gives no time to a member whose 
name  has  been  deleted  to  file  an  appeal  before  the  Registrar  and  have 
decided the matter before the nomination process commences.  
6. 
Counsel for Respondent No.6 argued that ESC has jurisdiction in the 
matter and in terms of the election rules the ESC hears all objections against 
the voters list and passes a final order making all additions and corrections to 
the  electoral  rolls.  Learned  counsel  has  placed  on  record  the  election 
schedule and the notifications appointing the ESC. Against the order of the 
ESC  the  right  of  appeal  lies  before  the  Registrar  Cooperative  which  is  the 
proper  forum  to  hear  the  matter.  Both  counsel  in WP No.160181/2018  and 
WP  No.154849/2018  prayed  that  the  matter  be  referred  to  the  Registrar 
Cooperative for a decision on merits.  
7. 
Convener  ESC  present  in  Court  stated  that  as  per  his  understanding 
the ESC passed the orders of deletion as per its jurisdiction and that it was 
competent  to  delete  the  names  of  members  who  do  not  quality  to  be 
members.

8. 
Heard and record perused. The basic issue in these petitions is the role 
of the ESC when considering objections against the voters list. The relevant 
rules  are  the  Election  Rules  of  the  Cooperative  Model  Town  Society.  In 
terms  of  the  Election  Rules  preliminary  list  of  members  is  prepared 
blockwise, sixty days before the date  on which the election is  scheduled to 
be  held.  A  Sub-Committee  consisting of  the  President  and two  members  is 
appointed by the Managing Committee who will hear and pass orders on the 
objections raised on the voting list  within ten days of the last date fixed for 
filing objections. After the objections are filed and finally disposed of by the 
ESC, the list  of additions  and  corrections of  the  electoral  rolls is published 
and  a  final  voter  list  is  made  available.  In  terms  of  the  election  schedule 
issued  by  the  ESC,  the  last  date  for  filing  objections  against  the  voter  list 
was  23.01.2018,  which  were  to  be  decided  within  two  days  and  the  final 
voters  list  was  displayed  on 27.01.2018.  In  terms  of  the  Election Rules  the 
ESC  hears  objections  on  the  voters  list  for  the  purposes  of  addition  and 
correction  in  the  voters  list.  Basically  this  entails  a  verification  process 
wherein  the  ESC  has  to  finalize  the  voters  list  on  the  basis  of  which  the 
election  can  take  place.  The  voters  list  provides  for  the  names  of  the 
members and the relevant block number, the membership number, the CNIC 
number  and  a  comment  as  to  whether  the  member  is  a  defaulter.  This 
information  on  the  list  has  to  be  verified  and  confirmed  by  the  ESC  and 
additions  and  corrections  are  made  to  the  information  provided.  Therefore, 
the scope of work of the ESC so far as hearing objections on the voters list is 
limited to verification of the contents of the list to ensure that every name on 
the list is that of a member from the given blocks. The ESC can pass orders 
to the extent that it can make corrections and additions to the list to remove 
duplications,  correct  mistakes  in  the  details  given  and  delete  the  name  of 
persons who have died. The ESC however cannot pass orders with respect to 
the  qualification  and  eligibility  of  a  member  and  cannot  pass  orders  on 
whether  a  person  is  entitled  to  be  a  member.  Membership  and  the  rights 
attached thereto are controlled by the Byelaws of the Society as well as by 
the Act. In terms of the Byelaws of the Society the process to make members 
WP No.156887/2018 
5 
is  provided  under  Byelaws  No.1  to  18.  Byelaw  No.19  provides  for  the 
termination of membership and Byelaw No.20 provides for the expulsion of 
a member. So far as expulsion of a member is concerned, in terms of Byelaw 
No.20 (1) a member may be expelled from membership by a vote of not less 
than two-third of the members present which took place in general meeting 
of  the  Society.  Therefore,  the  power  of  expulsion  of  any  member  as  per 
Byelaw No.20 lies with the General Body of the Society. In terms of Section 
17 (b) of the Act, the Registrar can expel a member, who is a defaulter of the 
dues of the Society. Hence to the extent of expulsion of members, all parties 
before  the  Court  agree  that  it  can  only  be  done  through  a  meeting  of  the 
General Body or in terms of Section 17 (b) of the Act.  
9. 
Respondent  No.6  and  the  Chairman  of  the  ESC  relied  upon  Byelaw 
No.19 (c) to urge the point that ESC can terminate  membership in terms of 
Byelaw  No.19.  However  this  argument  is  misconceived  and  against  the 
spirit  of  the  Act  and  Election  Rules.  A  bare  reading  of  Rules  (iv),  (v)  and 
(vi) of the Election Rules makes it clear that ESC can only  make additions 
and  corrections  in  the  voters  list.  The  ESC  cannot  adjudicate  upon  the 
qualifications  of  a  member  and  order  to  terminate  the  membership.  In  the 
cases before the Court the ESC passed orders on objections filed against the 
voters list (WP Nos.156887 and 160181 of 2018) wherein it was stated that 
the  Petitioners  are  not  qualified  to  be  members  of  the  Society  in  terms  of 
Byelaw  No.13  (2)  of  the  Society.  In  order  to  determine  whether  the 
Petitioners  stand  terminated  from  their  membership  consequent  to  the 
qualification provided in Byelaw No.13 (2) of the Society, the matter has to 
be placed before the General Body/Managing Committee which has to hear 
the matter and pass an order whereafter right of appeal will be available to 
such a person before the Registrar Cooperative.  
10. 
It is noted that in terms of the election schedule the last date for filing 
objections was 23.01.2018 and the objections had to be decided within two 
days. During this time in a situation such as in the instant petition where an 
order has been passed deleting the name of the Petitioners from the voter list 
because  they  are  not  qualified  to  be  the  members,  leaves  the  Petitioners 
WP No.156887/2018 
6 
remediless  as  they  are  unable  to  appeal  the  order  of  the  ESC  within  the 
required time as per the election schedule. Hence the Petitioner came to this 
Court seeking interference in the matter.  
11. 
In view  of  what  has been stated above,  WP Nos.156877  and  160181 
of 2018 are accepted and the order dated 24.01.2018 and 30.01.2018 passed 
by  ESC  are  set  aside.  The  Petitioners  may  proceed  with  the  nomination 
process  and  participate  in  the  election  for  the  Managing  Committee  of  the 
Society. So far as WP No.154849/2018 is concerned, the same is dismissed.
