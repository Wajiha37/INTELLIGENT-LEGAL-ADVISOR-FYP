AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through  this  writ  petition 
the  petitioners  have  challenged  the  order  dated  17.01.2017 
passed  by  the  learned  trial  court  whereby  an  application  under 
Order I Rule 10 of the CPC moved by respondents No.1 to 3 for 
impleading them  as  defendants  in the suit  was  accepted  and  the 
order/judgment  dated  25.02.2017  passed  by 
the 
learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  Gujranwala  whereby  the  revision 
petition filed by the petitioners was dismissed.  
2. 
 
Respondents  No.1  to  3  are  already  proceeded 
against ex-parte vide order dated 24.04.2017. Respondents No.4 
and  5  have  been  served,  even  P.C.  was  issued  for  today  but  no 
one is present on their behalf. Therefore, respondents No.4 and 5 
W.P.No.7048 of 2017.  
2 
are proceeded against ex-parte. Whereas respondents No.6 and 7 
are formal.  
3. 
 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners 
at length and also gone through the record minutely.  
4. 
 
A 
suit 
for  declaration  was 
filed  by 
the 
petitioners/plaintiffs on 06.11.2000 in which the injunctive order 
was  granted  on  18.05.2001.  The  suit  was  ultimately  decreed  on 
08.12.2009. An appeal was preferred by respondents No.4 and 5, 
which  was  dismissed  on  22.01.2011. A  Civil  Revision  No.1188 
of  2011  was  filed,  which  was  allowed  by  this  Court  and  matter 
was  remanded  to  the  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge.  During  this 
period 
the  applicants/respondents  No.1 
to  3  moved  an 
application under section 12 (2) of the CPC on 08.01.2010. The 
reply was filed. They also prayed for grant of interim injunction 
during  the  pendency  of  application,  which  was  refused  on 
08.04.2011.  An  appeal  there  against  was  also  dismissed  on 
09.03.2012.  They  filed  a  revision  petition  before  this  Court 
against that order bearing No.956 of 2012, which was withdrawn 
on  02.02.2016.  They  moved  an  application  under  Order  I  Rule 
10  of  the  CPC  in  the  suit  in  the  post  remand  proceedings 
admittedly  claiming  purchase  of  suit  property  during  “ut  lite 
pendente  nihil  innovetur”.  The  reply  was  filed  but  the  learned 
trial court accepted the application vide order dated 17.01.2017. 
A  revision  there  against  was  filed,  which  was  dismissed  by  the 
W.P.No.7048 of 2017.  
3 
learned revisional court vide order dated 25.02.2017. Hence, this 
writ petition.  
5. 
 
While 
referring 
the 
judgments 
reported  as 
“MUHAMMAD  ASHRAF  BUTT 
and 
others 
versus 
MUHAMMAD ASIF BHATTI and others” (PLD 2011 Supreme 
Court  905),  “FARZAND  Ali  and  another  versus  KHUDA 
BAKHSH  and  others”  (PLD  2015  Supreme  Court  187), 
“AASIA  JABEEN  and  3  others  versus  LIAQAT  Ali  and  others” 
(2016  S  C  M  R  1773),  “Mst.  TABASSUM  SHAHEEN  versus 
Mst.  UZMA  RAHAT  and  others”  (2012  S  C  M  R  983), 
“DILNAWAZ BEGUM and others versus MUHAMMAD AKBAR 
KHAN AFRIDI and others” (2017 CLC 1115) and “PROVINCE 
OF  THE  PUNJAB  through  Collector,  Sheikhupura  and  others 
versus SYED GHAZANFAR Ali SHAH and others” (2017 S C M 
R  172)  leaned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  argues  that  the  party 
purchasing the suit property during pendent lite has absolutely no 
right  to  move  for  impleadment  and  further  while  relying  upon 
“GHULAM 
RASOOL 
versus 
SETTLEMENT 
AND 
REHABILITATION COMMISSIONER and others” (1980 S C M 
R  921)  states  that  the  applicants  cannot  be  joined  in  the  post 
remand  proceedings,  therefore  stated  that  application  was 
absolutely  not  maintainable  and  the  learned  trial  court  was 
having  no  jurisdiction  to  allow  the  application  and  order  of 
dismissal  of  revision  passed  by  the  learned  revisional  court  is 
W.P.No.7048 of 2017.  
4 
also  without  jurisdiction.  Therefore,  prays  for  acceptance  of 
instant writ petition.  
6. 
 
I  have  gone  through  the  case  law  cited  by  the 
learned counsel for the petitioners. During the pendency of suit a 
purchaser  has  no  right  to  move  for  impleadment.  Light  can  be 
taken  from  the  judgment  of  august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 
reported  as  “MUHAMMAD  ASHRAF  BUTT  and  others  versus 
MUHAMMAD ASIF BHATTI and others” (PLD 2011 Supreme 
Court  905).  For  ready  reference  the  relevant  paragraph  is 
reproduced as under:- 
“It has been held “the doctrine of “lis pendens” is that one 
who  purchases  from  a  party  pending  suit  a  part  or  the 
whole of the subject-matter involved in the litigation takes 
it subject to the final disposition of the cause and is bound 
by the decision that may be entered against the party from 
whom he derived title.” 
 
Further  on  the  point  that  in  post  remand  proceedings  the 
applicants  cannot  be  joined.  Light  can  be  taken  from  the 
judgment  of  august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  reported  as 
“GHULAM 
RASOOL 
versus 
SETTLEMENT 
AND 
REHABILITATION  COMMISSIONER  and  others” 
(1980 
SCMR 921). In this view of the matter, the order passed by the 
learned  trial  court  dated  17.01.2017  allowing  the  application 
under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC moved by respondents No.1 to 
3 and impleading them as defendants in the suit and the order of 
learned revisional court dated 25.02.2017 dismissing the revision 
W.P.No.7048 of 2017.

petition  are  without  jurisdiction  and  declared  as  such.  This  writ 
petition is allowed in the above terms.
