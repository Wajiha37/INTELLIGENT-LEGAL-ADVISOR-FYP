     IN THE LAHORE HIGH COURT AT LAHORE

   C.R.No.4088 of 2016 
    Malik Board and Paper Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs. Tariq Saeed,etc. 
   JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
   06.03.2018  
Petitioner by               Mian Tahir Maqsood, Advocate 
Respondents 
           
 
Mr.Waqas  Qadeer  Sh.,  Advocate 
for 
respondent  No.1,  whereas  respondent  No.2 
was proceeded against ex parte on 06.12.2016. 
           Ch. Muhammad Masood Jahangir ,J: Although suit 
for  recovery  of  damages  of  Rs.500  million    on  account  of  malicious 
prosecution was instituted by the respondents/ plaintiffs on 12.07.2012, 
but without affixation of court fee. Learned Trial Court time and again 
required  them  to  make  up  the  said  deficiency,  which  was  ultimately 
made good on 15.05.2013. No doubt, prior to 15.05.2013, learned Trial 
Court had directed the petitioner/defendant to submit written statement, 
but neither prior to that date nor thereafter till 09.07.2013 it was filed, 
whereupon  by  applying  penal  consequences  of  Order  VIII  rule  10  of 
the  Code,1908,  the  right  of  submission  of  written  statement  of 
petitioner/defendant  was  struck  off.  Initially,  the  petitioner/defendant 
assailed  the  said  order  well  within  time  before  the  learned  District 
Court by filing Civil Revision, which was entertained and process was 
issued  for  summoning  of  respondents/plaintiffs,  who  appeared  as  well 
and when it was fixed for final arguments, the Revision Petition being 
beyond its pecuniary jurisdiction was returned by learned Addl. District 
Judge  vide  order  dated  28.06.2016  for  its  presentation  before  this 
Court,  resultantly  it  was  filed  before  this  Court  along  with  an 
application  under  section  14  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908  for 
condonation of delay.

3. 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
The  learned  Addl.  District  Judge  became  contributory  to 
cause  delay  for  the  presentation  of  instant  Civil  Revision  before  this 
C.R.No.4088/2016 
2 
Court.  Had  he  objected  at  very  first  point  of  time  while  realizing  that 
the said Court lacked jurisdiction  to entertain the same,  then the same 
might be filed by the  petitioner/defendant  well within time before this 
Court.  The  respondents/plaintiffs  also  raised  no  objection  that  learned 
District Court had no pecuniary jurisdiction to proceed any further for a 
considerable  time  despite  their  appearance,  hence,  C.M  No.1/C-2016 
for condonation of delay is allowed. 
4. 
It 
is  an  admitted  fact 
that  suit  was 
instituted  by 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs  without  affixation  of  court  fee  on  the  plaint, 
which  was  furnished  on  15.05.2013  after  almost  ten  months  of  its 
institution  and  prior  to  it  the  suit  was  not  competent  to  be  proceeded 
any further, what to talk to direct the petitioner/defendant to submit his 
written  statement.  The  case  diary  maintained  by  learned  Trial  Court 
further reveals that no doubt on 15.05.2013 when the deficiency of the 
court  fee  was  made  good,  the  case  was  adjourned  to  12.06.2013  for 
filing  of  written  statement,  but  on  the  said  day  the  file  was  placed 
before some other Judicial Officer being transferred on Administrative 
side and it was further adjourned by the Transferee Court in routine to 
05.07.2017  without  specifically  requiring 
the  filing  of  written 
statement,  whereas  on  05.07.2013  without  delivering  copy  of  plaint, 
the  case  file  was  adjourned  to  09.07.2013,  while  providing  only  four 
days’  time  to  the  petitioner  to  file  his  written  statement    and  on  his 
failure, the right of defence was struck off through the  impugned order 
passed on that very  day. The appreciation of  case diary of the learned 
Trial Court left no doubt in mind that after the suit when it was  made 
competent neither any sufficient time was afforded to the petitioner nor 
learned  Trial  Court  while  delivering  the  copy  of  the  plaint  had 
specifically  required  it  from  him.  The  apex  Court  in  the  judgment 
reported as Sardar Sakhawatuddin and 3 others Vs. Muhammad Iqbal 
and  4  others  (1987  SCMR  1365)  while  dealing  with  the  provisions  of 
Order VIII, rules 1, 9 and 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has 
held as under:- 
It  is  clear  from  the  combined  reading  of  Rules  1  and  9 
that amongst others three types of written statements can 
be filed by a defendant. 
1.  As a right without any formal permission           
of the Court. (Rule 1). 
2.  When it is so required by the Court to file 
a written statement (Rule 1 and Rule 9). 
3.  When  under  some  circumstances  it  is  by    
the leave of the Court (Rule 9). 
C.R.No.4088/2016

It  is  obvious  from  Rule 10  that  no  adverse  results  under 
these  Rules  are  to  follow  on  failure  to  file  written 
statement in cases mentioned in items Nos.1 and 3 above. 
But  penal  consequences  of  “pronouncement  of  judgment 
against”  him  when  the  defendant  fails  to  file  written 
statement when “so required”- - -as is  indicated in item 
No.2 above, would follow. 
As  it  is  a  penal  provision  it  will  have  to  be  strictly 
construed.  Hence  wherever  a  reasonable  doubt  arises 
regarding  its  interpretation  or  implementation,  it  shall 
have  to  be  resolved  in  favour  of  the  victim  of  its 
application.  Otherwise  too,  its  requirements  would  have 
to be established like those of Order XVII, Rule  3 which 
is  similarly  penal  in  nature.  See  Industrial  Sales  and 
Service,  Karachi  and  another  V.  Archifar  Opal 
Laboratories Ltd., Karachi PLD 1969 Kar.418. 
 
This Court having perused the order sheet is satisfied that the rule laid 
down  by  the  apex  Court  in  the  afore-noted  judgment  as  well  as  in 
cases reported as The Secretary, Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore 
and  another  Vs.  Khalid  Ahmad  Khan(1991  SCMR  2527),  Col.  Retd. 
Ayub  Ali  Rana  Vs.  Dr.  Carlite  S.  Pune  and  another  (PLD  2002  SC 
630),  Ghulam  Hussain  Vs.  Shahzada  Khurram  Nazir  (2011  YLR 
763) and Adil Textile Mills through Chief Executive and another Vs. Sui 
Northern Gas Pipeline Limited through Authorized Officer (PLD 2012 
Lahore  300)  regarding  the  “requirement”  of  the  Court    was  not 
complied  with  and  a  speaking  order  after  handing  over  copy  of  the 
plaint to the defaulting party is lacking in this case. Moreover, almost 
a  period  of  10  months  was  allowed  to  the  respondents  to  furnish  the 
court  fee  to  make  their  suit  competent,  hence  there  would  be  no 
injustice, if one more chance is afforded to the petitioner to submit his 
written  statement,  whereas  law  also  favours  adjudication  on  merits. 
Although  learned  counsel  for  respondent  has  placed  reliance  on 
judgments  reported  as  Chief  Secretary/Provincial  Government 
G.B.Gilgit and 3 others Vs. Abdur Raziq (2017 YLR 863) and Riaz ul 
Haq  and  others  Vs.  Muhammad  Asghar    and  others  (2017  SCMR 
1841),  but  with  all  compliments,  those  run  on  different  aspects  and 
cannot be stricto sensu applied to support the impugned order.  
 
6.        For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  instant  Civil  Revision  is 
allowed and subject to payment of costs of Rs.15000/-, which shall be 
paid  by  the  petitioner/defendant  to  the  respondents/plaintiffs  before 
learned Trial Court, impugned order is set aside and learned Trial Court 
will  proceed  with  the  suit  immediately  before  the  stage  when  defence 
C.R.No.4088/2016 
4 
of  the  petitioner  was  struck  off.  The  parties  are  directed  to  appear 
before  learned  Trial  Court  on  26.03.2018  for  further  proceedings, 
which will afford one fair opportunity to petitioner/defendant spreading 
over  not  more  than  twenty  days  to  file  his  written  statement,  failing 
which law will take its own course.
