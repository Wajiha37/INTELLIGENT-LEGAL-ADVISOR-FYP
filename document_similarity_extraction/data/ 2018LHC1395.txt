Main Petition 
Succinctly,  the  petitioner  was  incorporated  on 
06.06.1934  under  the  Companies  Act,  1913  presently  existing 
under  the  Companies  Act,  2017.  The  respondent  No.3  was  a 
member of the petitioner Company but due to demeanour of the 
respondent  No.3  in  the  past  his  membership  was  suspended, 
which was only restored upon his assurance to amend his ways 
but all this proved to be wishful thinking. The respondent No.3, 
once again, allegedly indulged in transgression due to which on 
03.12.2017,  the  Secretary  of  the  petitioner  issued  a  Notice 
calling a meeting of the Disciplinary Committee to look into the 
misconduct  of 
the 
respondent  No.3 
and  gave 
its 
recommendations, 
in 
the  meanwhile  on  06.12.2017  his 
(respondent  No.3’s)  membership  was 
suspended.  The 
recommendations  of 
the  Disciplinary  Committee  were 
considered  by  the  Executive  Committee  on  12.12.2017,  in 
W.P.No.174637 of 2018   
 
 
 
 
                  2 
which  the  respondent  No.3  was  also  present  as  a  Regular 
member rather he despite asking refused to recuse himself from 
the  meeting.  The  Executive  Committee  approved 
the 
suspension of the respondent No.3 and a suspension letter was 
issued to the said effect on 18.12.2017. A Notice for calling an 
Extraordinary  General  Meeting  was  issued  on  18.12.2017,  in 
the  meanwhile  a  requisition  was  also  submitted  by  14  Regular 
Members  for  calling  of  an  Extraordinary  General  Meeting, 
which was convened on 09.01.2018 and the respondent No.3’s 
membership  was  terminated  by  the  requisite  majority  in  the 
Extraordinary  General  Meeting    as  per  Article  7(1)  of  the 
Articles  of  Association  of  the  Company  and  his  name  stands 
removed  from  the  Register  of  Members  and  Form  29  in  this 
regard  has  also  been  submitted  to  the  Securities  &  Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan. 
 
The  respondent  No.3  instead  of  accepting  his  fate  under 
the  Companies  Act,  2017  approached  the  Civil  Court  and 
instituted  a  suit  for  declaration,  permanent  and  mandatory 
injunction  with  consequential  relief  titled  “Naveed  M.  Sheikh 
v. The Honorary Secretary of the Lahore Polo Club etc.”  The 
present  petitioner  entered  appearance  and  at  the  outset  raised 
objection  to  jurisdiction  by  the  Civil  Court  but  vide  impugned 
order  dated  18.01.2018,  the  learned  Civil  Judge  overruled  the 
objection with regard to his jurisdiction ad held that Civil Court 
has jurisdiction to entertain the lis in hand. Being aggrieved of 
the  said  order,  the  petitioner  filed  a  revision  petition,  but  the 
learned  Additional  District  Judge  vide  impugned  order  dated 
26.02.2018 dismissed the same; hence, the instant constitutional 
petition. 
2. 
 
Main 
thrust  of 
the 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
petitioner  is  on  the  ground  that  the  Civil  Court  has  no 
jurisdiction to entertain suit as the incorporated entities and all 
matters pertaining thereto are tried and adjudicated upon under 
W.P.No.174637 of 2018   
 
 
 
 
                  3 
the Special Law i.e. The Companies Act, 2017, because it is an 
established  principle  that  a  special  law  overrides  the  general 
law and section 4 of the Act ibid expressly overrides any other 
law;  therefore,  except  the  Company  Bench  of  this  Court  no 
other Court has the jurisdiction to entertain any lis pertaining to 
an  incorporated  entity.  He  has  prayed  for  acceptance  of  the 
constitutional  petition  in  hand,  setting  aside  of  the  impugned 
orders  and  return  of  plaint  of  the  suit  instituted  by  the 
respondent No.3 under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. Relies on Brother Steel Mills Ltd. and others 
v. Mian Ilyas Miraj and 14 others (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 
543),  Lahore  Race  Club  through  Secretary  and  others  v.  Raja 
Khushbakht-Ur-Rehman  (PLD  2008  Supreme  Court  707), 
Mian  Javed  Amir  and  others  v.  United  Foam  Industries  (Pvt.) 
Ltd.,  Lahore  and  others  (2016  SCMR  213)  (2016  CLD  393), 
State  Life 
Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan 
through 
Chairman  and  others  v.  Mst.  Sardar  Begum  and  others  (2017 
CLD 1080-Supreme Court of Pakistan), Syed Mushahid Shah 
and  others  v.  Federal  Investment  Agency  and  others  (2017 
CLD  1198-Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan)  and  Muhammad 
Yasin  Fecto  and  another  v.  Muhammad  Raza  Fecto  and  3 
others (1998 CLC 237-Karachi). 
3. 
 
On  the  contrary,  learned  counsel  representing  the 
respondent  No.3  have  supported  the  impugned  orders  by 
arguing that the orders sought to be declared illegal through suit 
for  declaration  are  based  on  mala  fide,  therefore,  the  Civil 
Court,  being  Court  of  plenary  jurisdiction,  enjoys  the  powers 
and  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  suit;  thus,  the  learned  Courts 
below  have  rightly  exercised  vested  jurisdiction.  The  instant 
constitutional  petition  may  be  dismissed.  Reliance  has  been 
placed  on  D.M.  Malik  v.  Jockey  Club  of  Pakistan  and  others 
(PLD 1960 (W.P.) Karachi 325), Khawaja Muhammad Saeed 
v. Mr. Justice Shabbir Ahmad and 12 others (PLD 1965 (W.P.)

Heard. 
It is settled principle by now that Courts generally 
refuse  to  interfere  in  the  decision  of  a  club  on  disciplinary 
matters  if  given  without  any  irregularity  in  procedure  unless  it 
is proved either that the rules were opposed to natural justice or 
that they were not properly followed or that there was malice or 
mala  fides  in  arriving  at  the  decision  or  that  principles  of 
natural  justice  were  not  being  followed.  Thus,  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  Court  in  such  cases  is  limited  within  a  very  narrow 
compass  and  if  the  Managing  Committee  of  a  Club  or  an 
Association  has  acted  bond  fide  and  honestly,  followed  the 
W.P.No.174637 of 2018   
 
 
 
 
                  5 
principles  of  natural  justice  and  has  reasonably  construed  its 
rules in their application to the aggrieved party, the Civil Courts 
have  no  jurisdiction  to  interfere  in  a  matter  where  disciplinary 
action is taken against its members. 
 
In the present case, it is evident from the facts of the case 
that  the  respondent  No.3’s  membership  was  cancelled  and  his 
name  was  removed  from  the  Register  of  Members  of  the 
Company after giving him opportunity of hearing and to defend 
his  stance  before  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Club  and 
when  he  refused  to  recuse  himself  from  the  meeting,  the 
Executive  Committee  approved 
the  suspension  of 
the 
respondent No.3 and a suspension letter was issued to the said 
effect  on  18.12.2017;  whereafter  a  Notice  for  calling  an 
Extraordinary  General  Meeting  was  issued  on  18.12.2017,  in 
the  meanwhile  a  requisition  was  also  submitted  by  14  Regular 
Members  for  calling  of  an  Extraordinary  General  Meeting, 
which was convened on 09.01.2018 and the respondent No.3’s 
membership  was  terminated  by  the  requisite  majority  in  the 
Extraordinary  General  Meeting    as  per  Article  7(1)  of  the 
Articles  of  Association  of  the  Company  and  his  name  was 
removed  from  the  Register  of  Members  and  Form  29  in  this 
regard  was  also  submitted  to  the  Securities  &  Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan. Section 4 of the Companies Act, 2017 
reads:- 
to  override.—Save  as  otherwise 
‘4.  Act 
expressly provided herein--- 
(a) 
the  provisions  of  this  Act  shall  have  effect 
notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any  other 
law or the memorandum or articles of a company 
or  in  any  contract  or  agreement executed by it  or 
in  any  resolution  passed  by  the  company  in 
general  meeting  or  by  its  directors,  whether  the 
same be registered, executed or passed, as the case 
may be, before or after the coming into force of the 
said provisions; and 
contained 
the 
(b) 
memorandum,  articles, 
contract,  agreement, 
arrangements or resolution  aforesaid shall, to  the 
provision

provisions of  this  Act,  become, or be,  void,  as the 
case may be.‟ 
 
Section 5 of the Act ibid reads:- 
„5. 
Jurisdiction  of  the  Court  and  creation  of 
Benches.—(1)  The  Court  having 
jurisdiction 
under  this  Act  shall  be  the  High  Court  having 
jurisdiction  in  the  place  at  which  the  registered 
office of the company is situate. 
(2).  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any 
other law no civil court as provided in the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908) or any other 
court  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  any  suit 
or  proceeding  in  respect  of  any  matter  which  the 
Court is empowered to determine by or under this 
Act.

The above provision of law expressly bars jurisdiction of Civil 
Court  in  the  matters  pertaining  of  Company  matters  and  word 
“shall”  has been  used in  the  same, which  makes  is  mandatory, 
especially  when  there  appears  no  mala  fide  or  ill-will  on  the 
part  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Club,  who,  as  stated 
above, has followed the rules after submission of requisition by 
14  Regular  Members  for  calling  of  an  Extraordinary  General 
Meeting,  convened  on  09.01.2018  and  terminated  the  member 
of  the  respondent  No.3  by  the  requisite  majority  in  the 
Extraordinary  General  Meeting    as  per  Article  7(1)  of  the 
Articles  of  Association  of  the  Company/Club  and  his  name 
stands removed from the Register of Members and Form 29 in 
this  regard  has  also  been  submitted  to  the  Securities  & 
W.P.No.174637 of 2018   
 
 
 
 
                  7 
Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan.  Since  the  name  of  the 
respondent  No.3  has  been  cancelled  and  his  name  has  been 
removed  from  the  Register  of  the  Members  of  the  Company, 
and  Form  29  has  already  been  submitted  to  the  SECP,  the 
matter strictly falls within the ambit of Companies jurisdiction, 
because  it  has  converted  to  “rectification  of  the  Register”, 
which instance is dealt with under section 126 of the Act  ibid, 
which provides:- 
 
 
„126.  Power of Court to rectify register.—(1) If— 
(a) the  name  of  any  person  is  fraudulently  or 
without  sufficient  cause  entered  in  or  omitted 
from  register  of  members  or  register  of 
debenture-holders of a company; or 
(b) default  is  made  or  unnecessary  delay  takes 
place in entering on the register of members or 
register  of  debenture-holders  the  fact  of  the 
person  having  become  or  ceased  to  be  a 
member or denture-holder;  
the  person  aggrieved,  or  any  member  or 
the 
debenture-holder  of 
to 
company,  may  apply 
for 
rectification of the register.‟ 
the  company,  or 
the  Court 
 
The  “Court”  in  the  above  section  126  of  the  Act  is  the 
Company  Judge  of  the  High  Court  as  has  been  provided  in 
section  5  of  the  Act  ibid.  Reliance  is  placed  on  Lahore  Race 
Club  through  Secretary  and  others  v.  Raja  Khushbakht-Ur-
Rehman  (PLD  2008  Supreme  Court  707),  Mehran  Ginning 
Industries  etc.  v.  Sajid  Shafique  etc.  (2017  CLD  1165),  and 
Brother Steel Mills Ltd. and others v. Mian Ilyas Miraj and 14 
others (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 543) wherein it was held:- 
“The  proceedings  under 
the  Ordinance  are 
initiated  in  the  High  Court  as  a  Court  of  first 
instance.  While  exercising  such  jurisdiction  it  has 
the  characteristics  and  attributes  of  the  original 
jurisdiction.” 
 
In  addition  to  the  above,  Section  4  of  Part-A  of 
6. 
 
Chapter  2  of  the  Volume-I  of  the  Rules  and  Orders  of  the 
Lahore High Court, Lahore provides:- 
W.P.No.174637 of 2018   
 
 
 
 
                  8 
to 
Jurisdiction.—Under 
those  enactments  e.g. 
“4.  Special 
certain 
enactments,  Courts  of  Civil  Judges  have  no 
jurisdiction  at  all 
take  cognizance  of 
proceedings  under 
the 
Companies  Ordinance,  1984  (XLVII  of  1984),  the 
Banking  Companies  Recovery  of  Loan  Ordinance 
(XIX  of  1979),  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts 
Act,  (XXXV  of  1964),  etc.  There  are  proceedings 
under  certain  other  enactments  of  which  Civil 
Judges  can 
if  specifically 
empowered  in  that  behalf  e.g.  section  4-A  of  the 
Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, read with section 
25 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964.‟ 
take  cognizance 
 
This  matter  has  been  resolved  once  and  for  all  in  judgments 
reported  as  Mian  Javed  Amir  and  others  v.  United  Foam 
Industries (Pvt.) Ltd., Lahore and others (2016 SCMR 213). 
7. 
 
Apart  from  the  above,  it  is,  by  now,  settled 
principle of law, that provisions of special law always override 
the  provisions  of  general  law  to  the  extent  of  any  conflict  or 
inconsistency between the two. In this regard reliance is placed 
on  Syed  Mushahid  Shah  and  others  v.  Federal  Investment 
Agency  and  others  (2017  CLD  1198-Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan)  and  State  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan 
through Chairman and others v. Mst. Sardar Begum and others 
(2017 CLD 1080-Supreme Court of Pakistan) wherein it has 
invariably been held:- 
„Hence where a Special law determines a place of 
suing, which in the present case in terms of section 
2(6)  could  be  either  the  principal  Civil  Court  of 
Original  jurisdiction  in  a  district  or  the  special 
Civil  jurisdiction  of  the  Sindh  High  Court  and 
Islamabad  High  Court,  the  same  would  prevail 
over  the  provisions  of  section  15  of  the  Code  of 
Civil  Procedure.  It  is  now  trite  law  that  the 
provisions  of  special  law  always  override  the 
provisions  of  the  general  law  to  the  extent  of  any 
conflict or inconsistency between the two.-----------

8. 
 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  when  there  appears  no 
mala fide and malice on the part of the Executive Committee in 
cancelling  the  membership  and  removing  the  name  of  the 
respondent  No.3  from  the  Register,  the  Civil  Court  has  no 
jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the High Court being Court 
of first instance has the jurisdiction to deal with such matters as 
has been provided under section 5 of the Companies Act, 2017. 
The learned Courts below have misconstrued law on the subject 
and have wrongly exercised jurisdiction vested in them. 
9. 
 
So  far  as  the  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  respondent  No.3,  with  utmost  respect,  has  no 
relevance to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in 
hand, as has been discussed above; therefore, it does not render 
any  assistance  or  help  to  the  respondent  No.3’s  case,  being 
distinguished one. 
10. 
 
In view of the above, the constitutional petition in 
hand is allowed, impugned orders are set aside and the plaint in 
suit instituted by the respondent No.3 is ordered to be returned 
under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
for  its  presentation  before  the  Court  of  competent  jurisdiction, 
if desired and advised. No order as to the costs.
