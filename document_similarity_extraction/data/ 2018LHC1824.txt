MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Regular Second Appeal (“RSA”), appellants have assailed 
order dated 14.10.2013  and judgment & decree dated 24.10.2017, 
passed  by  learned  Civil  Judge  and  Additional  District  Judge, 
Lahore, respectively, whereby respondent No.1’s application under 
Section 151 C.P.C. for appropriate direction to respondent No.1 to 
deposit  the  remaining  consideration  amount  of  Rs.90,00,000/-  as 
well  as  transfer  and  delivery  of  possession  of  the  suit  property  in 
his  favour,  was  disposed  of  in  the  manner  that  respondent  No.1’s 
suit  was  decreed  subject  to  payment  of  balance  consideration 
amount  i.e.  Rs.90,00,000/-  in  the  Court  within  fifteen  clear  days 
from the order of the Court, failing which, suit would result in per 
se dismissal.  
2. 
Brief facts, discernible from averments of instant appeal, are 
that the agreement to sell dated 31.07.2012 was executed between 
appellants  and  respondent  No.1,  whereby  bungalow  bearing 
property  No.454  Block-A,  D.H.A.  Phase-V,  Lahore  Cantt., 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
2 
possessed  and  owned  by  the  appellants,  was  agreed  to  be  sold  to 
respondent No.1 against consideration of Rs.2,42,00,000/-. Out of 
said  amount,  Rs.32,00,000/-  was  paid  by 
the  purchaser 
/ 
respondent  No.1  as  advance  money  /  Biana  on  the  same  date  i.e. 
31.07.2012  to  the  sellers  /  appellants.  As  per  clause  4  of  the 
agreement, Rs.100,00,000/- were to be paid by respondent No.1 on 
or  before  30.08.2012  and  the  remaining  consideration  amount  of 
Rs.1,10,00,000/-  was  to  be  paid  by  respondent  No.1  on  or  before 
01.10.2012  at  the  time  of  transfer.  As  per  clause  7  of  the 
agreement,  if  respondent  No.1  failed  to  pay  the  remaining 
consideration  amount  to  appellants  by  the  due  dates,  his  earnest 
money  would  be  treated  as  forfeited  and  according  to  clause  14 
thereof,  respondent  No.1  shall  be  put  into  possession  of  the 
bungalow,  subject  to  development  of  the  area,  as  and  when  the 
balance  consideration  amount  is  paid  by  respondent  No.1  to 
appellants.  A  further  agreement  to  sell  dated  01.09.2012  was 
executed  between  the  parties,  whereby  the  fact  of  payment  of 
Rs.100,00,000/-  was  acknowledged.  As  per  clause  4  of  the 
subsequent  agreement,  it  was  once  again  stipulated  that  balance 
consideration  amount  of  Rs.1,10,00,000/-  shall  be  paid  by 
respondent No.1 on or before 01.10.2012 at the time of transfer, as 
stipulated in the earlier agreement dated 31.07.2012 and by virtue 
of  clause  5  of  the  latter  agreement,  it  was  agreed  that  the  other 
terms and conditions of the agreement to sell dated 31.07.2012 will 
remain  the same  as  operative  and  applicable  on  this  agreement  to 
sell.  Respondent  No.1  assertively  failed  to  perform  his  part  of 
agreement 
and 
paid 
only  Rs.20,00,000/- 
instead 
of 
Rs.1,10,00,000/-.  Appellants  served  a  legal  notice,  through  their 
counsel, upon respondent No.1, whereby respondent No.1 filed suit 
for  possession  through  specific  performance  of  agreement  to  sell 
dated  31.07.2012  along  with  permanent  injunction.  The  said  suit 
was contested by appellants by filing written statement. During the 
course  of  proceedings,  respondent  No.1  filed  application  under 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
3 
Section 151 C.P.C. for appropriate direction to respondent No.1 to 
deposit  the  remaining  consideration  amount  of  Rs.90,00,000/-  as 
well  as  transfer  and  delivery  of  possession  of  the  suit  property  in 
his favour, which was disposed of vide order dated 14.10.2013 in 
the  manner  that  respondent  No.1’s  suit  was  decreed  subject  to 
payment of balance consideration amount i.e. Rs.90,00,000/- in the 
Court within fifteen clear days from the order of the Court, failing 
which,  suit  would  result  in  per  se  dismissal.  Feeling  aggrieved, 
appellants  filed  Regular  First  Appeal  before  learned  Division 
Bench  of  this  Court,  which  was  returned  /  transferred  to  learned 
District  Judge,  Lahore  after  enhancement  of  the  pecuniary 
jurisdiction. Appellants filed appeal against order dated 14.10.2013 
before  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  which  was  dismissed 
vide judgment & decree dated 24.10.2017. Hence, this RSA. 
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  appellants  submits  that  impugned 
decisions of learned Courts below are based upon mis-reading and 
non-reading of available record. He adds that as per clauses 4 & 5 
of  the  second  agreement  to  sell  dated  01.09.2012,  it  was  agreed 
that  the  balance  consideration  amount  of  Rs.1,10,00,000/-  would 
be paid by respondent No.1 on or before 01.10.2012, at the time of 
transfer, and other terms and conditions of earlier agreement to sell 
dated  31.07.2012  would  remain  the  same.  Thus,  clause  4  of  the 
earlier agreement dated 31.07.2012 stood novated, but this material 
aspect  of  the  case  has  been  overlooked  while  passing  impugned 
decisions.  He  further  submits  that  learned  Courts  below  have 
misinterpreted  and  wrongly  invoked  the  provisions  of  Order  XII 
Rule 6 CPC. He further submits that learned counsel for appellants 
made a conditional statement dated 16.01.2013 to the effect that if 
respondent  No.1  deposited  the  remaining  consideration  amount 
within 15-days, the suit of respondent No.1 be decreed and in case 
of  default,  the  suit  be  dismissed.  He  adds  that  learned  trial  Court 
was  required  to  frame  issues  in  order  to  resolve  the  controversy 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
4 
instead of deciding the matter by invoking the provisions of Order 
XII  Rule  6  CPC.  He  further  submits  that  respondent  No.1  must 
have been ready and willing to fulfill his part of the agreement and 
his  refusal  to  make  payment  of  balance  consideration  amount  on 
frivolous  ground  of  delivery  of  possession  prior  to  payment  of 
balance  consideration  amount,  entails  dismissal  of  the  suit.  He 
further  submits  that  due  to  non-performance  of  his  part  of  the 
agreement,  respondent  No.1  was  not  entitled  to  the  equitable  and 
discretionary relief of specific performance in terms of Section 22 
of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. He further submits that the legal 
principle  that  time  was  generally  not  the  essence  of  contract, 
cannot be indiscriminately  applied. In  support of his submissions, 
he  has  placed  reliance  upon  Malik  Muhammad  Hayat  Khan  v. 
Subedar Yar Muhammad Khan (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 612), 
Gulzar  Khan  v.  Mst.  Shahzadi  Bibi  and  another  (PLD  1974 
Supreme  Court  204),  Saudi-Pak  Industrial  and  Agricultural 
Investment Company (Pvt.) Ltd., Islamabad v. Messrs Allied Bank 
of  Pakistan  and  another  (PLD  2003  Supreme  Court  215), 
Rasheedur  Rehman  Khan  v.  Mian  Iqbal  Hussain  (PLD  2006 
Supreme Court 418), Mst. Maryam Bibi and others v. Muhammad 
Ali through L.Rs. (2007 SCMR 281), Muhammad Abdur Rehman 
Qureshi  v.  Sagheer  Ahmad  (2017  SCMR  1696),  Sheikh  Rehmat 
Ilahi  v.  Mohammad  Hayat  Khan  and  others  [A.I.R.  (30)  1943

others  (PLD  1956  Dacca  29),  Concentrate  Manufacturing

(Private) Limited and 3 others (2002 CLD 77), Parveen Umar and

Partner  v.  Director-General  of  Income-Tax,  Sialkot  and  2  others

others (2010 YLR 2452).  
4. 
Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  defends  the 
impugned decisions and submits that appellants failed to abide by 
the terms and conditions of the agreements to sell reached between 
the  parties.  They  add  that  as  per  clause  4  of  the  agreement,  the 
balance consideration amount of Rs.110,00,000/- was to be paid by 
respondent  No.1  on  or  before  01.10.2012  at  the  time  of  transfer 
and as per clause 7 of the agreement, on failure of respondent No.1 
to  pay  the  remaining  consideration  amount  to  appellants  by  the 
above  mentioned  date,  his  earnest  money  would  be  treated  as 
forfeited and according to clause 14, respondent No.1 shall be put 
into  possession  of  Bungalow,  subject  to  development  of  the  area, 
as  and  when  the  balance  consideration  amount  is  paid  by 
respondent  No.1.  He  adds 
that 
the  fact  of  payment  of 
Rs.100,00,000/-, made through two cheques of Rs.50,00,000/- each 
dated  03.09.2012,  was  incorporated  in  a  further  agreement  to  sell 
and  as  per  clause  4,  it  was  once  again  stipulated  that  balance 
consideration  amount  of  Rs.110,00,000/-  shall  be  paid  by 
respondent No.1 on or before 01.10.2012 at the time of transfer. In 
the  end,  they  submit  that  appellants  have  failed  to  point  out  any 
illegality  or  legal  infirmity  in  the  impugned  decisions,  thus,  same 
are  liable  to  be  upheld  in  circumstances.  In  support  of  their 
contentions,  they  have  relied  upon  Naseem  Akhtar  v.  Abdul 
Rehman Khan (2017 CLC Note 79) and Wazir and others v. Haji 
Dilbar and others (2017 CLC Note 83). 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6.  
The main ground which prevailed upon learned courts below 
for  invoking  the  provisions  of  Order  XII  Rule  6  CPC  for  passing 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
6 
decree  on  admission,  was  that  the  appellants  were  at  fault  in 
delivery  of  possession  upon  receipt  of  balance  amount.  The  said 
reasoning, ex-facie is not supported from record, rather apparently 
based upon misreading and non-reading of relevant clauses. As per 
stance  of  appellants,  balance  consideration  amount  was  not  paid 
despite  legal  notice  and  offer  of  deposit  within  15  days  through 
statement  dated  16.01.2013.  In  order  to  determine  the  factum  of 
default  of  appellants    qua  delivery  of  possession,  the  relevant 
clauses  4,  7  &  14  of  agreement  to  sell  dated  31.07.2012  are 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“4. 
to  sell  and 
the  Sellers  has  agreed 
That 
the 
Purchaser  has  agreed  to  purchase  the  above  said 
Bungalow  at  a  price  of  Rs.2,42,00,000/-  (Rupees 
Two  Crore  Forty  Two  Lac  Only)  (With  All  Dues 
Cleared) out of which Rs.32,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty 
Lac  only)  has  been  paid  as  Biana  in  the  following 
manners:-  
Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lac Only) Cash. 
i. 
Rs.30,00,000/-  (Rupes  Thirty  Lac  only)  vide 
ii. 
Cheque  No.18007434,  dated  30.07.2012,  drawn  on 
Habib Metropolitan Bank Lahore.  
Receipt  of  which  is  hereby  acknowledged  by  the 
Sellers.  The  balance  amount  of  Rs.1,00,00,000/- 
(Rupees  One  Crore  only)  shall  be  paid  by  the 
Purchaser as Part Payment on or before 30-08-2012. 
And  the  remaining  balance  amount  Rs.1,10,00,000/- 
(Rupees One Crore Ten Lac only) shall be paid by 
the Purchaser on or before 01.10.2012 at the time of 
transfer. 
7. 
That  if  the  purchaser  fails  to  pay  the  remaining 
amount  to  the  Sellers  by  the  above  mentioned  date 
his earnest money (biana) will be treated as forfeited. 
Likewise  if  the  Sellers  commits  fault  /  default  or 
refuses  to  transfer  the  Bungalow  in  favour  of  the 
Purchaser  he  will  be  liable  to  pay  double  amount  of 
the biana to the purchaser.  
14.  That 
the  purchaser  shall  be  put 
into  physical 
possession  of  Bungalow  (subject  to  development  of 
the area) as and when the balance amount is paid by 
the purchaser to the Sellers.” 
 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
7 
 
Likewise,  clauses  4  &  5  of  further  agreement  to  sell  dated 
01.09.2012 are reproduced hereunder:- 
“4.  Balance  amount  of  Rs.1,10,00,000/-  (Rupees  One 
Crore Ten Lac only) shall be paid by the Purchaser 
on or before 01-10-2012 at the time of transfer.  
5. 
Other Terms and conditions of the Agreement to sell 
a  Bungalow  (Biana)  executed  on  31  July  2012  will 
remain the same as operative and applicable on this 
extended Agreement as well.” 
 
7. 
The  above  clauses  show 
that  respondent  No.1  paid 
Rs.32,00,000/-  as  earnest  money.  It  was  clearly  mentioned  in  the 
former  agreement  that  if  respondent  No.1  fails  to  pay  the 
remaining  consideration  amount  to  the  appellants  by  the  target 
dates,  his  earnest  money  would  be  treated  as  forfeited  and 
similarly,  however,  if  the  appellants  commit  fault  /  default  or 
refuse to transfer the Bungalow in favour of respondent No.1, they 
would be liable to pay double amount of Biana to respondent No.1. 
As per clause 14, physical possession of the Bungalow in question 
would be handed over to respondent No.1, subject to development 
of  the  area  as  and  when  the  balance  consideration  amount is paid 
by  him  to  the  appellants.  Prima  facie,  clauses  4  &  5  of  further 
agreement  to  sell  dated  01.09.2012  show  that  upon  receipt  of 
balance payment delivery of possession is to be made. Undeniably 
balance  payment  was  made  during  pendency  of  suit,  after  more 
than  6  months  of  the  offer  made  by  the  appellants  to  respondent 
No.1  to  deposit  remaining  consideration  amount  within  15  days.  
Even otherwise, it was a disputed question of fact, determination of 
which requires recording of evidence. The disposal of the case in a 
summary manner is unsustainable in the eye of law.  
8. 
The  statement  dated  16.01.2013,  of  learned  counsel  of 
present appellants was misconstrued and misinterpreted by learned 
courts below in the impugned order and judgment while invoking 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
8 
provisions  of  Order  XII  Rule  6  CPC.  The  said  statement  reads  as 
under:-

9. 
It  is  self  evident  that  offer  was  firstly  restricted  for  a 
period of 15 days only  but respondent No.1 neither accepted the 
offer  nor  made 
the deposit, 
rather 
took  up 
the  plea 
that deposit could  not  be  made  because  appellants  failed  to 
deliver  possession  as  per  the  agreements.  Since  offer  was  time 
bound/  restricted, it was never  made  for an indefinite  period of 
time. Offer thus automatically stood withdrawn on expiry of the 
time  given  by  the  appellants  and  in  any  case,  it  was  never 
perfected  through  acceptance  by  the  respondent  No.1,  in  terms 
of  section  2(b)  of  the  Contract  Act,  1872.  Therefore,  it  never 
culminated  into  a  binding  contract  between  the  parties, besides 
there was no offer when the appellants pressed for enforcing the 
consequences  of  the default  on  the part  of  the  respondent  No.1 
in making the deposit within the time given in the said offer and 
in  terms  of  the  order  of  the court. Appellants,  thereafter,  had 
never  given  any  consent  for  the  extension  /  enlargement  of  the 
time,  rather  throughout  had  been  insisting  for  the  dismissal  of 
the  suit  on  account  of 
respondent  No.1's 
failure 
to 
make deposit within  time.  Despite  that,  the Court, on  its  own, 
granted  extension  and  directed  respondent  No.1  to deposit the 
arrears of consideration in the Court by the next date of hearing, 
failing  which,  the  suit  would  be  considered  to  have  been 
dismissed.  Where  one  party  had  made  an  offer  to  the  other  for 
performance of  an  act  within  a  particular  period  of  time,  and 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
9 
such act was not performed, the court, without the consent of the 
party, making an offer, could not  enlarge time while exercising 
its powers under section 148 or 151, C.P.C. and it was only with 
the consent of party offering, that time could be further granted. 
Present  case  was  not  covered  by  Order  XII,  Rule  6,  C.P.C.  or 
Order  XV,  Rule  1,  C.P.C.  and  the  respondent  No.1    had  never 
asked  the court to  pass  the  decree  in  terms  of  the  offer  of  the 
appellant,  rather  joined  the  issue  about  delivery  of  possession. 
Court, in view of scheme of C.P.C. and in circumstances, should 
have decided the suit after holding trial.  
10.        Even otherwise, in order to attract provisions of Order 
XII,  Rule  6,  C.P.C.  admission  should  necessarily  be 
unequivocal, clear, unconditional and unambiguous. Court while 
dealing  such  application  for  grant  of  decree  must  exercise  its 
discretion in a judicial manner, subject to qualification regarding 
maintainability  of  suit  on  any  legal  objection  going  to  the  very 
root  of  the  matter.  Court  should  not  grant  decree  on  admission 
without  resorting  to  objections  raised.  While  passing  judgment 
and decree, real question in controversy remained undetermined 
which  could  not  be  decided  without  adducing  evidence  by 
parties  on  all  issues  including  those  two  which  were  subject-
matter of application under Order XII, Rule 6, C.P.C. Reference 
can  be  made 
to  Amir  Bibi  v.  Muhammad  Khurshid 
(2003  SCMR  1261)  and  Col.  Javed  Iqbal  Lodhi  v.  Lt.  Col. 
Nadeem Ahmar (2007  CLC  831). 
11.  Article  10-A  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”) enshrines the right to fair trial 
and  due  process,  which  includes  framing  of  issues  in  view  of  the 
divergent pleadings of the parties, recording evidence and hearing 
arguments. Any  process  falling  short of the  above ingredients  not 
only constitutes patent illegality but violates the said provisions of 
R.S.A. No.101289 of 2017 
 
10 
the Constitution. A Court of law is under a legal obligation to hold 
fair trial as per Article 10-A of the Constitution.  
12.    Needless  to  observe  here  that  in  view  of  the  commercial 
nature  of  the  property  business  and  trend  of  rapid  increase  in  the 
prices  of  immovable  property,  the  sellers  could  not  be  left  at  the 
mercy of buyer to bind him in an agreement to sell and then delay 
the  completion  of  the  contract  for  as  long  as  he  may  wish  hiding 
behind  an  archaic  legal  principle  that  in  contracts  involving 
immovable  property,  time  is  generally  not  of  the  essence  of 
contract.  The  said  rule  had  to  be  revisited  keeping  in  view  the 
changed circumstances and time was not of the essence of contract 
could  not  indiscriminately  be  applied.  Reference  can  be  made  to 
Muhammad  Abdur  Rehman  Qureshi  v.  Sagheer  Ahmad  (2017 
SCMR 1696). 
13. 
In  view  of  the  above  discussion,  instant  appeal  is  allowed. 
Impugned order and judgment passed by learned Courts below are 
set-aside  and  case  is  remanded  to  the  learned  trial  Court  for  its 
decision  afresh  after  framing  issues  and  recording  evidence  and 
hearing  arguments  of  the  parties  on  controversial  points  involved 
in  the  case  without  being  influenced  by  the  finding  recorded 
hereinabove,  within  a  period  of  four  months  from  the  date  of 
receipt  of  certified  copy  of  this  judgment  under  intimation  to  the 
Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court.
