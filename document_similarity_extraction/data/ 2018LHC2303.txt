Addl. District Judge, etc.  
Sr. No. of order/

Date of order/ 
Proceeding 
Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
Parties’ counsel, where necessary 
17.09.2018.  Mr.  Abdul  Ghaffar  Khan  Chughtai,  Advocate  for 
the petitioner. 
 
The  petitioner  challenges  the  order 
dated  09.07.2018,  whereby  the  Addl.  District 
Judge,  Haroonabad,  dismissed 
the 
revision 
petition  filed  by  the  petitioner  against  the  order 
dated  27.10.2017  passed  by  Civil  Judge, 
Haroonabad,  through  which  application  filed  by 
the  petitioner  under  Section  12(2)  of  the  C.P.C 
was dismissed  and  the  court refused  to  set-aside 
the  judgment  and  decree  dated  23.01.2014, 
whereby  the  suit  of  the  respondent  for  recovery 
of  Rs.87,000/-was  decreed  against  the  petitioner 
as  prayed  for.  The  petitioner  through  the  afore-
referred  application  under  section  12(2)  C.P.C 
challenges  the  impugned  ex-parte  judgment  and 
decree  dated  23.01.2014  as  according  to  him 
respectables  of 
locality  got 
effected 
a 
compromise  between 
the  parties  and  had 
restrained  him 
to  contest 
the 
said 
suit. 
Furthermore, it is argued that the original cheque 
had  not  produced  in  the  court  in  support  of  the 
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  2 
 
claim of the respondent, therefore, the suit should 
not have been decreed.  
2.     
Heard. Record perused.  
3.     
The respondent has obtained a decree 
for recovery of Rs.87,000/-against the petitioner, 
which  the  petitioner  assails  on  the  ground  of 
fraud and misrepresentation.  In order to succeed 
in  his  claim  filed  through  application  under 
section  12(2)  of  the  C.P.C,  the  petitioner  was 
required 
to 
show 
some 
fraud 
or 
misrepresentation  committed 
in 
the  court 
proceedings  culminating 
in 
the 
impugned 
judgment  and  decree  dated  23.01.2014  and 
establish  the  said  plea  through  cogent  material 
whereby  the  said  application  could  be  allowed. 
Reliance  in  this  behalf  is  placed  on  a  Division 
Bench  judgment  of  Lahore  High  Court  in  Ms. 
Shazia  Ashraf  vs.  Municipal  Committee, 
Sahiwal  through  administrator  and  another 
(2006  CLC  1018)  wherein  it  is  provided  that 
provisions  of  Section  12(2)  CPC  can  only  be 
pressed  into  service  where  fraud  was  played  or 
misrepresentation  was  made 
during 
the 
proceedings  of  the  suit  in  the  court  and  not  if 
done outside the court.   
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  3 
 
4. 
 
The  ground  raised  by  the  counsel  for 
the petitioner  is  that he  was  prevented  to  appear 
in  the  court  and  contest  the  suit  but  the  record 
shows  that  several  opportunities  were  provided 
to  him  to  produce  evidence  before  closing  his 
right.  Besides  nothing  is  available  on  the  record 
to  show  that  the  petitioner  was  prevented  from 
appearing in the court and contesting the claim of 
the respondent. Even if the petitioner claims that 
the  matter  had  been  settled  outside  the  court  for 
which  purpose  he  was  prevented  by 
the 
respectables  from  appearing  in  the  court  to 
defend  the  case,  suffice  it  to  say  that  the 
petitioner had the knowledge of pendency of the 
case  and  could  appear  in  the  court  to  inform 
about  the  settlement  of  the  matter  outside  the 
court,  which  was  not  done.  It  was  also  the  duty 
of the petitioner to keep himself informed of the 
status  of  court  proceedings  until 
the  case 
culminated into a final decision but the petitioner 
instead  absented  himself  and  is  now  raising  the 
plea  that  he  had  been  prevented  from  appearing 
in  the  court.  In  somewhat  similar  situation,  in 
2011  MLD  1956  [Peshawar]  (Syed  AMEER 
HUSSAIN  SHAH  versus  Syed  DILBAR  HUSSAIN 
SHAH and 3 others) it has been held as under:- 
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  4 
 
“8.  It  was  also  the  bounden  duty  of  the 
petitioner  to  inform  the  Court  about  the 
alleged  compromise.  If  at  all  it  was  not 
admitted  or  acknowledged  by  the  respondent 
No.1,  then  the  remedy  was  available  under 
Order  XXIII  Rule  3,  C.P.C.  to  seek  the 
attestation  of  such  comprise  by  filing  the 
same  in  the  Court,  and  in  case  it  has  not 
been  admitted  by  the  other  side,  then  the 
petitioner  was  at  liberty  to  prove  the  terms 
and conditions of the alleged compromise but 
instead of availing the proper remedy, on the 
same  facts  and  circumstances,  he  has  filed 
the  instant  application  which  is  apparently 
not maintainable. 
9. It is also not appealing because even after 
filing  the  suit  for  redressal  of  his  grievance, 
the  petitioner  did  not  attend  the  court  in 
order  to  get  himself  informed  about  the 
status  of  proceedings  and  also  about  the 
proceedings being carried out in the suit filed 
by the petitioner and sufficient to dislodge his 
claim.  Even  if  the  promise  made  by  the 
respondent  No.1  was  false,  even  then  it does 
not  fall  within  the  provision  contained  in 
section  12  (2),  C.P.C.  as  merely  falsity  of 
claim to the knowledge of the person putting 
forward  the  claim  would  not  be  the  ground 
for setting aside the decree on the ground of 
fraud  has  not  been 
fraud.  When 
committed 
for 
obtaining  a  judgment,  it  cannot  be  termed 
that the fraud has been committed within the 
purview  of  above  section  of  law.  In  this 
respect,  reference  can  be  made  to  a  case 
titled  Lal  Din  and  another  v.  Muhammad 
Ibrahim  (1993  SCMR  710).  Provision  of 
Section 12(2), C.P.C can only be pressed into 
fraud  was  played  or 
service  where 
misrepresentation  was  made  during 
the 
proceedings  of  the  suit  in  Court  and  not  if 
done  outside  the  Court.  Reference  may  be 
made to 2006 CLC 1018. 
10.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 
argued  that  neither  issues  has  been  framed 
nor  evidence  recorded,  therefore,  prejudice 
has  been  caused 
the 
petitioner.  The  learned  Courts  below,  after 
going through the record of the case, arrived 
at  a  conclusion  that  the  matter  can  be 
decided on the face of it and there is no need 
to  frame  issues  and  record  the  evidence. 
Whenever the Court does not think it proper 
that  the  proceedings  should  be carried  on in 
accordance  with  provision  of  C.P.C.,  it  has 
the power to refuse the framing of issues and 
recording  of  evidence.  Similar  question  was 
raised in case titled Mrs. Amina Bibi through 
General  Attorney.  V.  Nasrullah  and  others 
(2000 SCMR 296) and it was resolved that:- 
the  rights  of 
proceedings 
in  Court 
the 
to 
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  5 
 
“Be 
that  as 
(2)  C.P.C 
 
it  may,  while 
dealing  with  the  allegations  under 
section  12 
is  not 
incumbent  upon  the  Court  that  it 
must, 
in  all  circumstances,  frame 
issues,  record  evidence  and  follow  the 
procedure  prescribed  for  decision  of 
the suit.”” 
it 
  
5. 
  
In  the  present  case,  the  petitioner  not 
only  absented  himself  from  appearing  in  the 
court but also did not keep himself abreast of the 
status of court proceedings resultantly the decree 
was passed against him. The plea of compromise 
outside  the  court  has  also  not  been  established 
through  any  cogent  material  available  on  the 
record. 
  Even  otherwise  after  recording  of 
evidence  of  the  respondent  at  least  twelve 
opportunities  were  provided  to  the  petitioner  to 
lead  evidence  but  the  same  were  not  availed, 
consequently  right  to  produce  evidence  was 
closed.  The  plea  that  respectables  prevented  the 
petitioner  from  appearing  in  the  court  is  not 
tantamount to a fraud committed inside the court 
proceedings,  besides  the  same  is  not  established 
on record  and  appears  to  be  an  afterthought  and 
is consequently turned down. 
6.     
The plea of non-production of original 
cheque  in  evidence  before  the  trial  court  relates 
to matter of procedure and merits of the case and 
not  to  fraud  or  misrepresentation  committed 
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  6 
 
during  the  court  proceedings,  therefore,  the  plea 
raised by the petitioner is without any substance 
and,  consequently,  the  decree  could  not  have 
been  challenged 
through  application  under 
Section  12  (2)  of  the  C.P.C  rather  the  petitioner 
should  have  availed  some  other  legal  remedy  to 
challenge the same. The petitioner claims that the 
respondent had returned back the original cheque 
to  him  and  had  received  the  payment  for  the 
same outside the court and had falsely raised the 
claim  on  the  basis  of  returned  cheque  by 
concealing  the  said  fact  but  this  aspect  of  the 
matter  has  also  not  been  established  on  the 
record either by producing the original cheque or 
any  material  to  support  the  said  claim.  Had  the 
cheque  been  returned  to  the  petitioner,  he  could 
have easily produced the same before the court to 
establish  his  claim  but  the  same  had  not  been 
done.  Even  otherwise,  falsity  of  claim  to  the 
knowledge of a person putting forward the claim 
is not a ground for setting-aside the decree on the 
ground of fraud.  Reliance in this regard is placed 
on  Lal  Din  and  another    vs.  Muhammad 
Ibrahim  (1997  SCMR  710).    Consequently,  the 
petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  any  fraud  or 
misrepresentation  committed 
in 
the  court 
                                              W.P.No.7920-2018/BWP                                                  7 
 
proceedings  to  obtain  the  judgment  and  decree 
dated  23.01.2014,  therefore,  the  said  decree 
cannot be set aside in proceedings under section 
12(2) CPC.  
7. 
 
No  illegality  or  erroneous  exercise  of 
jurisdiction  has  been  pointed  out,  whereby 
application  under  Section  12  (2)  of  the  C.P.C 
filed  by  the  petitioner  can  be  allowed,  and  the 
learned trial court was justified in dismissing the 
same. Consequently, no ground to interfere in the 
impugned orders/judgment is made out.  
8. 
 
For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 
this  petition  being  devoid  of  any  merits  is 
dismissed.
