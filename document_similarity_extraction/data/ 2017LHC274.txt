Tersely,  respondent  No.3  filed  a  composite 
suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage;  return  of  dowry 
articles  and  maintenance,  on  13.01.2010  which  was 
contested  by  the  petitioner.  Upon  conclusion  of 
proceedings 
the 
learned  Judge  Family  Court, 
Samundri (respondent No.2) vide judgment & decree 
dated  14.02.2011  dissolved  marriage  between  the 
parties subject to return of Rs.60,000/- by respondent 
No.3 to  the petitioner. Further, respondent  No.3  was 
also held entitled to receive Rs.1,25,000/- as price of 
dowry  articles  in  addition  to  maintenance  for  the 
Iddat period at the rate of Rs.2,000/- per month. The 
judgment  &  decree,  dated  14.02.2011,  passed  by 
respondent  No.2,  was  assailed  by  both  sides by  way 
of filing independent appeals which were decided by

and  enhanced  the  alternate  price  of  dowry  articles 
from  Rs.1,25,000/-  to  Rs.1,50,000/-.  As  no  party 
further assailed judgment dated 09.07.2011 passed by 
respondent No.1 the same attained finality and during 
the course of execution proceedings respondent No.3 
made  a 
statement,  on  01.03.2014, 
regarding 
satisfaction  of  the  decree  whereupon  execution 
petition was disposed of. 
2. 
 In  addition  to  above  suit,  on  30.07.2011, 
respondent  No.3  filed  another  suit  for  recovery  of 
gold  ornaments  weighing  13  tolas  (gold  bangles

weighing  6-tolas  and  one  tola  in  the  shape  of  ear

petition has impugned aforesaid judgments & decrees 
dated 14.02.2011 and 18.02.2016.   
4. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits 
that  as  the  earlier  suit  filed  by  respondent  No.3  for 
recovery  of  dowry  articles  was  decided  by  the  court 
of  competent  jurisdiction,  the  subsequent  suits  were 
not  maintainable;  that  according  to  Order  II  rule  2 
CPC,  respondent  No.3  was  bound  to  lay  her  claim 
before the court in entirety but having not done so the 
subsequent  suits  were  hit  by  the  principle  of 
constructive  res-judicata; 
that  astonishingly 
the 
learned  Judge,  who  dismissed  the  suit  filed  by

Learned  counsel 
representing 
respondent 
No.3,  while  defending 
impugned 
judgments  &

applicable  in  family  suits,  the  principle  of  res-
judicata  is  not  applicable  in  the  suit  filed  by 
respondent  No.3;  that  respondent  No.3  claimed 
dowry articles which were given to her in Bari which 
was  not  the  subject  of  two  other  suits  thus  the  same 
was  not  hit  by  the  principle  of  res-judicata;  that 
according  to  the  Schedule  attached  with  the  West 
Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, nine types of suits 
can be filed before the Family Court and one does not 
exclude  the  other;  that  during  the  course  of  cross-
examination DW-1 admitted that the articles given to 
respondent  No.3  in  Bari  were  taken  back  by  the

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable  length  and  have  also  gone  through  the 
documents  annexed  with  this  petition  as  well  as  the 
case-law cited at the bar. 
7. 
Firstly 
taking  up  the  question  regarding 
applicability  of  principle  of  res-judicata  in  family 
suits,  I  am  of  the  view  that  to  decide  the  said 
controversy  a  perusal  of  section  17(1)  of  the  West 
Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  is  of  vital 
importance  which  for  convenience  of  reference  is 
reproduced herein below: - 
“17.        Provisions  of  Evidence  Act  and  Code 
of Civil Procedure not to apply.–  
(1)  Save  as  otherwise  expressly 
provided  by  or  under  this  Act,  the 
provisions  of  the  Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984  (P.O.  No.  10  of  1984),  and  the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, except 
sections  10  and  11 shall not  apply to 
proceedings before any Family Court 
in respect of Part I of Schedule.”

According to the afore-quoted section the provisions 
of  Qanoon-e-Shahadat  Order  1984  and  CPC  are  not 
applicable except sections 10 & 11 CPC. Section 11 
CPC deals  with res-judicata, thus, one  thing  is  clear 
that  principle  of  res-judicata  is  also  applicable  to 
family suits.  
8. 
A  perusal  of  first  suit  filed  by  respondent 
No.3  shows  that  she  prayed  for  dissolution  of 
marriage  in  addition  to  recovery  of  dowry  articles 
and  maintenance.  In  the  plaint  of  her  first  suit  she 
made  a  reference  to  certain  things  given  by  her 
parents in addition to the list attached with the suit. In 
the  list  of  dowry  articles,  besides  other  items,  she 
also referred to gold ornaments at serial No.48 of the 
list  of  dowry  articles  with  the  clarification  that  the 
same  were  given  by  her  cousins  at  the  time  of 
marriage.  Further,  to  the  extent  of  Articles  47  &  49 
she did not clarify as to from whom she received the 
same.  According 
to 
the  contents  of  Mark-A, 
produced during the course of hearing of the first suit 
filed  by  respondent  No.3,  15-tola  gold  ornaments 
given  by  the  parents  of  respondent  No.3  were  also 
incorporated. Respondent No.3 in her subsequent suit 
for return of personal belongings prayed for return of

and  gold  ornaments  worth  Rs.3,00,000/-  at  serial 
No.85  of  the  list  of  dowry  articles  produced  in  the 
first suit. If for the sake of academic discussion, plea 
raised  by  respondent  No.3  that  as  in  the  first  suit 
respondent  No.3  did  not  lay  any  claim  for  return  of 
gold ornaments,  is presumed to be correct even then 
there is no explanation on the part of respondent No.3 
for not claiming the gold ornaments subject matter of 
her  third  suit.  More  importantly,  in  her  suit  filed  on 
30.07.2011 respondent No.3 in Para No.7 thereof has 
inter-alia averred as under: - 
 
 
The  contents  of  above-quoted  para 
leaves  no 
ambiguity  that  at  the  time  of  filing  of  suit  for 
recovery  of  gold  ornaments  she  was  fully  aware 
about the said claim in her earlier suit. 
9.  With  a  view  to  cross  the  barrier  of  res-
judicata  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.3  has 
referred  to  Schedule  to  the  West  Pakistan  Family 
Courts  Act,  1964  according 
to  which  claims

of  children;  guardianship;  jactitation  of  marriage; 
dowry; personal property and belongings of wife and 
a  child  living  with  her  and  any  other  matter  arising 
out  of  Nikah  Nama  are  amenable  to  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  Family  Court.    There  is  no  cavil  with  the 
preposition that a wife can file multiple claims before 
the Family Court, however, once she has filed a suit 
regarding  specific  subject  matter  she  cannot  be 
allowed  to  file  a  subsequent  suit  for  the  self-same 
relief.  
10. 
Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.3  has 
vociferously  argued  that  as  gold  ornaments  claimed 
by  respondent  No.3  in  her  suit  for  recovery  of  gold 
ornaments  were  part  of  Bari  same  having  not  been 
claimed  by  her  earlier,  principle  of  res-judicata  was 
not  applicable.  In  this  regard,  I  am  of  the  view  that 
during  the  course  of  hearing  of  her  first  suit  she 
produced  list  of  dowry  articles  wherein  15-tola  gold 
ornaments were incorporated with clear cut note that 
same  were  given  by  her  parents.  The  omission  of 
words Bari does not make any difference at all. Even 
otherwise,  according  to  section  7  of  the  West 
 
 
W.P. No.10894 of 2016.

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  a  facility  of 
composite suit  for dissolution  of  marriage  alongwith 
other  ancillary  claims  including  personal  property 
and belongings has been catered for. Though it is not 
mandatory for the wife to claim all said reliefs in one 
suit  but  when  a  wife  fails  to  lay  claim  in  entirety  in 
the  second  suit  the  principle  of  constructive  res-
judicata comes into play against any subsequent suit 
on the same subject.  
11.  A cursory glance over the statement made by 
PW-1  shows  that  though  the  petitioner  voluntarily 
stated  that  gold  ornaments  weighing  1½  tola  were 
given to respondent No.3 as Bari but he never stated 
that gold ornaments weighing 13-tolas were given in 
Bari.  Further  second  part  of  voluntary  statement  of 
DW-1  regarding  gold  ornaments  weighing  8½  tola 
could  not  be  considered  as  Bari  as  he  differentiated 
the  portion  of  gold  ornaments  which  were  given  as 
Bari and those which were given as gift. Further, he 
specifically  denied  suggestion  that  gold  ornaments 
weighing 12-tolas were with him.

Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
parties or counsel, where necessary 
 
against  Khula  is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  note  that 
Khula  relates  to  amount  of  dower  mentioned  in 
Nikah  Nama.  As  findings  of  respondent  No.2 
regarding  return  of  Rs.60,000/-  by  respondent  No.3 
to  the  petitioner  were  set-aside  by  respondent  No.1 
while deciding the appeal filed by the petitioner, the 
said  fact  cannot  be  made  subject  matter  of  any 
subsequent  proceedings  especially  when  execution 
petition  was  disposed  of  in  view  of  the  statement  of 
respondent No.3 that the decree was satisfied. 
13. 
It is very alarming to note that suit for return 
of personal belongings, filed by respondent No.3 was 
dismissed by Rana Shahzad Ashraf, the then learned 
Judge  Family  Court,  Samundri,  on  09.01.2014 
holding  that  the  same  was  not  maintainable.  The 
same  Presiding  Officer,  while  accepting  the  suit  for 
recovery  of  gold  ornaments,  on  30.06.2014,  did  not 
visualize the fact that he himself earlier turned down 
request of respondent No.3. Likewise the appeal filed 
by  respondent  No.3  against  order  dated  09.01.2014 
was  dismissed  by  Mr.  Imtiaz  Nadeem,  learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  vide  judgment  &  decree

mentioned  as  30.06.2015  whereas  same  was

announced  on  18.02.2016  but 
the  date  of 
announcement  has  been  incorporated  as  18.02.2015. 
The  said  pathetic  state  of  affairs  speaks  volumes 
about inefficiency and lack of judicial acumen on the 
part of the above-named Judicial Officers.  
14.  A  close  examination  of  the  suit  filed  by 
respondent  No.3,  on  30.07.2011,  shows  that  she 
claimed  recovery  of  gold  ornaments  weighing  13-
tolas  without  specifying  in  the  heading  of  the  suit 
regarding  its  nature.  Rana  Shahzad  Ashraf,  the  then 
Judge  Family  Court,  Samundri,  while  passing 
judgment & decree, dated 30.06.2014, treated it as a 
suit  for  recovery  of dower. It is  very  strange  to note 
that  how  he  imported  the  term  dower  of  his  own. 
Moreover, while dealing with Issues No.1, 3 & 5 the 
said Presiding Officer has observed that—

“*****However,  the  copy  of  the  list  Mark-A 
is available on the file which reveals that the 
plaintiff  had  claimed  15-tola  gold  ornaments 
given to the plaintiff by her parents.” 
In  view  of  afore-quoted  conclusion,  the  judgment  & 
decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 
Samundri,  cannot  remain  in  field  for  a  moment. 
Further,  the  appellate  Court  instead  of  applying  its 
independent  mind  toed  the  line  of  the  Court  of  first 
instance. 
15.  While  justifying  his  findings  under  Issues 
No.1,  3  &  4  Rana  Shahzad  Ashraf,  Judge  Family 
Court, Samundri has made a reference to the fact that 
as  father  of  the  present  petitioner  admitted  claim  of 
respondent  No.3 
regarding  snatching  of  gold 
ornaments  weighing  13-tolas  by  the  petitioner  at  the 
time of her ouster from the house she was entitled for 
recovery of the same. The said findings of the learned 
Judge  Family  Court  did  not  coincide  with  the 
statement  made  by  DW-1  in  the  suit  wherein 
judgment & decree dated 30.06.2014 was passed.  
16.  Another  important  facet  of  the  instant  matter 
is  that  not  only  two  different  suits  qua  somewhat 
identical  relief  between  the  same  parties  were  dealt 
with  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Samundri
