RESPONDENT No.1 BY:    Mr.  Umer  Farooq  Khawaja,  A. 
 
RESPONDENT No.3 BY:

Advocate.  
 
 
 
AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through this civil revision 
the  petitioner  has  challenged  the  judgment  &  decree  dated 
04.11.2016  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 
Sialkot whereby the appeal filed by the plaintiff/respondent No.3 
was  accepted  and  the  judgment  &  decree  dated  29.11.2012 
passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  1st  Class,  Sialkot  dismissing 
the suit, were reversed.  
2. 
 
The brief facts are that the plaintiff/respondent No.3 
filed  a  suit  for  declaration  on  14.10.2004  to  challenge  mutation 
No.2314  by  Muhammad  Akhtar  in  favour  of  his  mother  Mst. 
Resham  Bibi  attested  on  28.09.1995  and  mutation  No.2315  by 
Mst. Resham Bibi in favour of her daughter Mst. Shamim Akhtar 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
2 
attested  on  28.09.1995.  The  written  statement  was  filed  and  the 
suit  was  contested.  Learned  trial  court  framed  the  issues  and 
invited the parties to produce their respective evidence. Both the 
parties produced oral as well as documentary evidence in support 
of their versions. After the completion of trial suit was dismissed 
by  the  learned  trial  court  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated 
29.11.2012.  An  appeal  against  the  judgment  &  decree  was 
preferred  before  the  learned  first  appellate  court,  which  was 
accepted vide judgment & decree dated 04.11.2016. Hence, this 
civil revision by the petitioner/donee-defendant No.2.  
3. 
 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at 
full length and also gone through the record minutely with their 
able assistance.  
4. 
 
The facts as narrated by the learned counsel for the 
parties are that originally Feroz Din was the owner of 85-marlas 
of  land,  at  the  time  of  death  his  widow  Mst.  Resham  Bibi,  one 
son  Muhammad  Akhtar  and  three  daughters  Mst.  Shamim 
Akhtar, Mumtaz Begum and Asmat Parveen inherited him. Mst. 
Resham  Bibi  was  given  10-marlas,  Muhammad  Akhtar  30-
marlas  and  each  daughter  15-marlas  of  land.  The  case  of 
petitioner/donee is that Muhammad Akhtar transferred 30-marlas 
land owned by him to his mother Resham Bibi through oral gift 
mutation  No.2314  attested  on  28.09.1995.  Through  mutation 
No.2315 Mst. Resham Bibi gifted 2-kanals land in favour of Mst. 
Shamim  Akhtar,  the  land  which  she  received  from  her  son 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
3 
Muhammad  Akhtar  through  mutation  No.2314  measuring  30-
marlas  and  her  inherited  property  10-marlas.  It  is  pleaded  that 
Muhammad  Akhtar  died  issueless  in  the  year  1998  and  Mst. 
Resham  Bibi  died  in  the  year  1997.  The  suit  was  filed  on 
14.10.2004.  
5. 
 
Learned  counsel  for the  petitioner/defendant  argues 
that the appeal before the learned first appellate court was barred 
by 47 days.  
 
When  confronted  with  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner that whether he can substantiate his contention that the 
appeal  was  barred  by  time,  from  the  record  which  he  appended 
with  this  civil  revision;  prays  for  requisition  of  the  record  of 
learned appellate court.  
 
By perusal of the record appended with this civil revision 
the  contention  that  the  appeal  was  filed  before  the  learned  first 
appellate court with a delay of 47 days is not borne out. Since the 
arguments have been heard, therefore, the court does not think it 
proper  to  requisition  the  record  of  learned  appellate  court.  This 
assertion  of  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  is  repelled  due  to 
the fact that no substance is available on the file.  
6. 
 
Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued the 
point  that  he  produced  a  copy  of  application  as  Exh.P-7  filed 
before the Tehsildar for issuance of copy of Roznamcha Waqiati, 
on the basis of which the mutation was entered. The copy of said 
application  has  not  been  appended  with  this  civil  revision, 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
4 
therefore, the  civil  revision  is  defective  one. I  have  noticed  that 
Liaquat Ali was produced by the plaintiff herself as PW-1, who 
stated  that  record  of  Roznamcha  Waqiati  from  19.07.1995  to 
30.08.1995 is missing. In this view of the matter, non-appending 
the  copy  of  application  moved  before  the  Tehsildar  taken  in 
evidence  as  Exh.P-7  is  not  fatal  one  to  dismiss  the  revision  on 
this score only.    
7. 
 
The  contention  of  learned  counsel  for  respondent 
No.3 that in matter of inheritance there is no limitation. I do not 
agree  with  this  argument  advanced  by  the  learned  counsel  for 
respondent  No.3.  First,  it  is  not  a  case  of  inheritance  and 
secondly,  even  in  matters  of  inheritance  the  contention  that 
limitation is to be ignored is not a valid contention in the light of 
law laid down by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported 
as  “Muhammad  Islam  versus  Inspector  General  of  Police, 
Islamabad and  others”  (2011  S  C M  R  8),  “Farman Ali versus 
Muhammad  Ishaq  and  others”  (PLD  2013  Supreme  Court 
392),  “Mst.  GRANA  through  Legal  Heirs  and  others  versus 
SAHIB KAMALA BIBI and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 
167),  “Agha  Syed  MUSHTAQUE  ALI  SHAH  versus  Mst.  BIBI 
GUL  JAN  and  others”  (2016  S  C  M  R  910),  “NOOR  DIN  and 
another versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE and 
others” (2014 S C M R 513), “COMMISSIONER OF INCOME 
TAX,  COMPANIES  ZONE-IV,  KARACHI  versus  HAKIM  ALI 
ZARDARI”  (2006  S  C  M  R  170),  “ATTA  MUHAMMAD  versus 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
5 
MAULA  BAKHSH  and  others”  (2007  S  C  M  R  1446)  and 
“Hakim  MUHAMMAD  BUTA  AND  ANOTHER  versus  HABIB 
AHMAD and others” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 153). Further 
the  plaintiff  opted  not  to  appear  in  person  in  the  witness  box, 
rather she appointed one attorney for filing of suit and at the time 
of  making  the  statement  before  the  court  another  attorney  was 
appointed,  who  appeared  in  the  witness  box  as  attorney  of 
plaintiff.  She  is  the  permanent  resident  of  U.S.A.  which  shows 
the gravity of interest of the plaintiff in litigation.  
8. 
 
It  is  a  case  where  third  party  has  challenged  two 
mutations, one  mutation  by  Muhammad  Akhtar  issueless son  in 
favour of his mother Mst. Resham Bibi and second mutation by 
the  mother  who  transferred  the  whole  of  her  property  in  favour 
of her one daughter. Admittedly there were two other daughters, 
one of whom is the plaintiff, who is permanent resident of United 
States  of  America.  The  fraud  was  alleged  in  the  plaint  on  the 
ground  that  husband  of  the  petitioner/defendant  was  a  retired 
Patwari. Needless to observe that for pleading and proving fraud 
it was the responsibility of the plaintiff/respondent No.3 to plead 
and prove fraud on the basis of standard set out through the law 
declared by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as this 
Court  reported  as  “Mst.  SAHIB  NOOR  versus  HAJI  AHMAD” 
(1988 S C M R 1703), “MUHAMMAD YOUNAS versus WARIS 
BAIG  and  2  others”  (2012  CLC  1846)  and  “RASHEEDA 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
6 
BEGUM  versus  GHULAM  AHMED  and  another”  (2007  CLC 
172).  
9. 
 
I  am  of  the  considered  view  that  when  third  party 
challenges the validity of a mutation, the standard for proving its 
contention is different from the case where a party challenges the 
alleged transfer deed or oral mutation by that party in favour of 
the  defendant.  In  that  eventuality,  the  principle  of  shifting  of 
onus is applicable and only a statement on oath before the court 
by the plaintiff is sufficient, whereas when third party challenges 
the validity of mutation between two other parties, third party is 
required to plead and prove the fraud with full details. Nothing of 
this  sort  is  available  in  the  instant  case.  Only  pleading  that 
husband  of  the  donee/petitioner  was  a  retired  Patwari  is  not 
sufficient  to  hold  the  transactions  as  invalid.  When  the  donors 
remained alive two and three years after the impugned mutations 
and when attorney of the plaintiff Munawar Hussain appeared as 
PW-2 and stated in his examination in chief, which was recorded 
on 30.06.2011 that:- 
 مشیر و رتخا ہبقر ےس زاب زاس ےن یراوٹپ فیطل ہک اھت اوہ ملع اک تاب سا لبق
 لاس 
11/10 
۔ایل اورک
 لقتنم مان ےک یویب ینپا یب یب
 
This  admission  of  the  attorney  of  plaintiff  clearly  makes  the 
plaint  barred  by  time,  which  was  filed  on  14.10.2004  to 
challenge the gift mutations attested on 28.09.1995.  
10. 
 
In  this  view  of  the  matter,  the  judgment  passed  by 
the  learned  first  appellate  court  while  recording  the  findings  on 
C.R.No.485 of 2017.  
7 
issues No.2, 3 and 4 by ignoring the legal position (supra) is not 
sustainable under the law. The findings of learned trial court are 
well  reasoned  and  are  in  accordance  with  law.  Therefore,  the 
findings of learned first appellate court are declared to be nullity 
in  the  eye  of  law  and  as  such  not  sustainable.  Resultantly,  this 
civil  revision  is  allowed  and  the  impugned  judgment  &  decree 
dated  04.11.2016  passed  by  the  learned  first  appellate  court  are 
set-aside,  whereas  the  judgment  &  decree  dated  29.11.2012 
passed by the learned trial court  dismissing the suit filed by the 
plaintiff/respondent No.3 shall remain in the field.
