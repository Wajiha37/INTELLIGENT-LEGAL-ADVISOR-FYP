Succinctly,  one  Javed  died  issueless  leaving  two 
widows  to  inherit  his  legacy.  Mst.  Mehti  agreed  through 
agreement  to  sell  dated  12.09.1971  to  sell  her  land  measuring 
216 kanals in favour of Mst. Sakina Bibi. As she did not honour 
the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  agreement  of  sale  a  suit  for 
specific performance was filed, wherein a decree was passed on 
16.10.2014.  An  appeal  was  filed  by  respondent  No.3  but  the 
same  was  rejected  on  28.03.2015  being  non-maintainable.  To 
challenge  the  said  judgment  and  decree  an  application  under 
section  12(2)  C.P.C.  was  filed  by  respondent  No.3  on  the 
ground that he was legal representative of Mst. Mehti deceased. 
There was a checkered history with respect to the status claimed 
by  respondent  No.3.  He  had  earlier  claimed  himself  to  be  a 
legal  representative  on  the  basis  of  an  order  of  an  Additional 
District  Judge  dated  15.09.1983  and  got  mutation  No.1192 
entered  on  01.04.1999,  but  as  this  Court  issued  injunction, 
therefore,  the  same  stood  rejected  on  12.02.2000.  Another 
mutation bearing No.1624 was got entered by respondent No.3, 
that  time  claiming  to  be  heir  of  deceased  Mst.  Mehti,  but  he 
failed to prove himself as an heir, hence it too was rejected on 
the basis of order dated 09.10.2004. Respondent No.3 again got 
W.P.No.38940 of 2016 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            2 
mutation  No.1637  entered  on  08.10.2004  on  the  claim  of  a 
WILL  dated  17.09.1980  allegedly  executed  by  Mst.  Mehti,  but 
as  the  WILL  was  under  challenge,  the  mutation  bearing 
No.1637,  too,  stood  rejected  on  18.08.2009.  Allegedly,  these 
shifting stands taken by respondent No.3 to usurp the estate of 
Mst.  Mehti  were  sufficient  to  hold  his  claims  to  be  false  and 
fabricated, upon which an FIR No.133/2005, under section 419, 
420, 467, 468, 471  PPC  was  registered against  him  for  having 
fabricated the WILL and he remained in jail till he was granted 
bail by this  Court. To frustrate the agreement of sale in favour 
of late Mst. Sakina, respondent No.3 filed various applications 
but all these applications met with failure either on merits or on 
account  of  withdrawal  which  included  the  dismissal  for  non-
prosecution on  30.10.2012 of writ petition No.5617/2011 from 
this Court.  
At the moment a suit titled Jan Muhammad v. Province 
of Punjab and others was pending adjudication before the Civil 
Judge,  Okara,  which  was  filed  on  31.03.2011.  An  application 
under  section  12(2)  C.P.C.,  the  subject  matter  of  present 
petition, was filed by respondent No.3 wherein a detailed reply 
was  submitted  by  the  petitioners,  predecessor,  wherein  the 
learned  trial  Court  vide  order  dated  07.04.2005  framed  the 
issues.  This  order  was  challenged  before  the  learned  District 
Judge  by  the  petitioners  through  civil  revision  No.15  of  2015 
which  was  dismissed  vide  impugned  order  dated  23.04.2016 
with the following observations:- 
“As  so  many  controversies  with  respect 
to  the  suit  property  are  involved  under 
the  umbrella  of  question  of  law  and  fact 
which  could  only  be  resolved  through 
evidence produced by both the parties for 
the  just  decision,  hence  revision  petition 
is  hereby  dismissed.  Copy  of  the  instant 
order  be  sent  to  the  learned  trial  Court 
for information. Record be also sent back 
to 
trial  Court.  Instant 
learned 
the 
W.P.No.38940 of 2016 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            3 
revision  petition  be  consigned  to  record 
after its completion”.  
 
Learned counsel for petitioners has argued that the 
2. 
 
grounds enumerated justifying record of the evidence, either did 
not exist on the record or are the result of wrong appreciation of 
facts  and  law  by  the  learned  Revisional  Court.  Added  to  the 
above, the scope of proceedings under Section 12(2) C.P.C. has 
completely  been  deviated  by  the  Revisional  Court,  there  has 
been  a  circumscribed  jurisdiction  invokeable  under  section 
12(2) C.P.C. on the grounds that the impugned decree had been 
procured  through  fraud  and  misrepresentation  played  upon  the 
Court.  Learned  Revisional  Court  has  gone  much  beyond  the 
said  circumscribed  limit  while  giving  a  free  hand  to  the 
respondent No.3 to lead the evidence with respect to his status 
to  justify  his  right  to  file  an  application  under  section  12(2) 
C.P.C.,  which  is  beyond  the  scope  of  said  provision  of  law. 
Although  rule  10  of  Order  1  C.P.C.  can  be  invoked  by  the 
courts of law at any time of the proceedings but if the conduct 
of a party proves beyond any shadow of doubt that it is acting 
with malicious intentions not only to falsely grab the estate left 
by an issueless lady but also is the accused of fabrication of the 
WILL,  this  discretionary  power  has  to  be  exercised  with  much 
more  care  and  caution.  In  the  instant  case,  quite  a  number  of 
efforts  were  made  by  respondent  No.3  to  be  impleaded  on  the 
basis  of  changed  status  but  he  was  denied  that  induction  for 
many  years.  Initially  he  was  deleted  on  14.12.2010  against 
which  he  filed  a  revision  petition  which  was  dismissed  on 
08.03.2011.  He  thereafter  challenged  that  order  through  writ 
petition  No.5617/2011  which  stood  dismissed  for  non-
prosecution on 30.10.2012 and thereafter respondent No.3 took 
no  step  to  have  that  order  set  aside.  He  had  earlier  filed  an 
application  to  be  impleaded  on  21.03.2011  but  then  withdrew 
on 28.03.2011, this too estops him to be impleaded, yet another

                            4 
application under Order 1 Rule 10 C.P.C. was filed which stood 
dismissed  on  06.05.2013  and  even  civil  revision  against  that 
order  was  dismissed  on  11.10.2014  and  now  writ  petition 
No.505/2014  is  pending  before  this  Court.  Learned  Revisional 
Court  has  committed  a  jurisdictional  error  in  failing  to 
appreciate  the  evidence  while  rendering  the  impugned  order. 
The  litigation  in  the  instant  case  has  commenced  in  year  2000 
and  now  another  round  of  litigation  is  being  illegally  forced 
upon  the  petitioners  under  the  garb  of  petition  under  section 
12(2)  C.P.C.  The  intention  of  law  while  introducing  section 
12(2)  C.P.C.  was  in fact to  curtail the  agony  of the parties  but 
unfortunately  it  is  being  used  as  a  weapon  to  prolong  the 
miseries  of  the  parties.  The  very  shifting  stands  taken  by 
respondent  No.3  disentitle  him  to  file  a  petition  under  Section 
12(2)  C.P.C.    There  was  no  need  to  frame  the  issues,  nor  was 
there  any  requirement  to  lead  the  evidence.  Petition  under 
section 12(2) C.P.C. was incompetent in the eyes of law when a 
suit for declaration was already pending adjudication before the 
civil  Court.  This  case  safely  be  pleaded  in  the  suit  pending 
adjudication  before  the  learned  Civil  Judge.  The  third  ground 
which weighted with the learned Revisional Court was entirely 
beyond  the  scope  of  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.,  when  it  was 
observed that the decree dated 16.10.2014 has been passed in a 
suit  filed  on  09.05.2000  to  seek  the  enforcement  of  an 
agreement  dated  12.09.1971,  can  by  stretch  of  imagination  be 
considered to be ground for the setting aside of the decree under 
section  12(2)  C.P.C.  because  the  merits  of  those  proceedings 
cannot  be  allowed  to  be  challenged  through  a  maliciously 
motivated petition under Section 12(2) C.P.C. Submits that the 
impugned  orders  dated  23.04.2016  and  07.04.2015  passed  by 
the learned Courts below are illegal, unlawful and thus without 
lawfully authority and in case the same are not so declared and 
set at naught the petitioners are bound to suffer irreparable loss

and  injury.  He  has  prayed  that  by  allowing  the  constitutional 
petition in hand, the impugned orders may be set aside and the 
learned  trial  Court  may  be  directed  to  decide  the  application 
under section 12(2) of the C.P.C. after hearing arguments. 
3. 
 
Contrarily,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent 
No.3 has supported the impugned orders and has further argued 
that any person aggrieved of any order or judgment or decree, if 
his  rights  are  affected  adversely,  can  call  into  question  such 
order,  judgment  and  decree  by  filing  application  under  section 
12(2) of the C.P.C. He has further argued that statutory right of 
appeal  being  available  under  law  cannot  be  denied  merely 
because law provided another remedy. Lastly, he has prayed for 
dismissal of the constitutional petition in hand. Relies on H. M. 
Saya & Co., Karachi v. Wazir Ali Industries Ltd., Karachi and 
another (PLD 1969 Supreme Court 65), Ch. Jalal Din v. Mst.

Heard. 
After  hearing  arguments  and  going  through  the 
record  it  has  come  on  surface  that  the  respondent  No.3/ 
applicant in application under section 12(2) of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (Code) claims himself legal heir of Mst. Mahti 
as well as holder of a registered will in his favour, which is yet 
to  be  proved  by  him  as  a  suit  in  this  respect  on  his  behalf  is 
pending  adjudication,  meaning thereby  he  has  yet  to prove  the 
valid execution of alleged WILL in his favour as well as being

                            6 
declared as legal heir of Mst. Mahti. In the instant case, quite a 
number  of  efforts  were  made  by  respondent  No.3  to  be 
impleaded on the basis of changed status but he was denied that 
induction  for  many  years.  Initially  he  was  deleted  on 
14.12.2010 against which he filed a revision petition which was 
dismissed  on  08.03.2011.  He  thereafter  challenged  that  order 
through  writ  petition  No.5617/2011  which  stood  dismissed  for 
non-prosecution  on  30.10.2012  and  thereafter  respondent  No.3 
took no step to have that order set aside. He had earlier filed an 
application  to  be  impleaded  on  21.03.2011  but  then  withdrew 
on 28.03.2011, this too estops him to be impleaded, yet another 
application under Order 1 Rule 10 C.P.C. was filed which stood 
dismissed  on  06.05.2013  and  even  civil  revision  against  that 
order  was  dismissed  on  11.10.2014  and  now  writ  petition 
No.505/2014  is  pending  before  this  Court,  file  of  which  has 
been  summoned  and  has  been  gone  through,  which  goes  to 
evince  that  the  same  has  been  disposed  of  on  04.04.2017  with 
the following observation: 
 
‘2. 
It has been highlighted that the main suit in 
which  the  afore-noted  application  was  filed  has 
been  decreed  on  16.10.2014,  against  which 
petitioner  preferred  an  appeal  which  also  stood 
dismissed  on  28.03.2015,  whereupon,  Civil 
Revision  No.1402/2015  was 
filed.  It 
is  also 
highlighted  that  the  initial  judgment  and  decree 
dated 16.10.2014 has been set aside by the learned 
trial Court on an application filed by the petitioner 
under  section  12  (2)  CPC,  against  which  a  civil 
revision is pending before this Court. 
 
3. 
In view of the fact that this petition emanates 
from  an  interim  order  passed  by  the  learned  trial 
Court  and  since  the  main  suit  has  been  decided, 
W.P.No.38940 of 2016 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            7 
therefore,  there  is  no  live  issue  in  this  petition. 
Disposed of.’ 
The  appeal  filed  by  the  respondent  No.3  against  the  judgment 
and  decree  dated  16.10.2014  has  also  been  dismissed  on 
28.03.2015  by  the  learned  appellate  Court,  against  which  his 
civil  revision  bearing  No.1402 of  2015 titled  Jan  Muhamamd 
v.  Mst.  Sakina  Bibi,  etc.  is  also  pending  before  this  Court, 
which  has  been  got  adjourned  sine  die  vide  order  dated 
04.04.2017, which runs: 
 
 
‘2. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  at  the 
outset submits that the initial judgment and decree 
passed by the learned trial Court was set aside on 
an  application  under  Section  12  (2)  CPC  filed  by 
the petitioner, whereupon a civil revision has been 
filed  before  this  Court,  in  which  operation  of  the 
said  judgment  has  been  suspended.  He  submits 
that till the decision of the latter civil revision, this 
revision petition may be adjourned sine die. 
3. 
In view of the above, this revision petition is 
adjourned sine die. In case there is any unresolved 
issue between the parties, either of the parties can 
get this appeal resurrected through an appropriate 
application.’ 
It is pertinent to note here that during pendency of C.R.No.1402 
of 2015, the respondent No.3 filed an application under section 
12(2) of the Code without disclosing the factum of pendency of 
the  above  said  civil  revision  against  judgments  and  decrees 
dated  16.10.2014  and  28.03.2015  passed  by  the  learned  trial 
Court  and  learned  appellate  Court  respectively,  before  this 
Court  and  got  suspended  the  operation  of  the  decree  dated 
16.10.2014  vide  impugned  order  dated  23.04.2016,  against 
which  otherwise  the  said  civil  revision  No.1402/2015  was 
already  pending  adjudication  before  this  Court  and  was  not 
W.P.No.38940 of 2016 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            8 
finally  decided,  rather,  after  filing  of  the  instant  constitutional 
petition  and  during  its  pendency,  the  same  was  got  adjourned 
sine  die.  All  these  facts  proceed  to  show  how  the  respondent 
No.3 by  twisting  facts  used  powers  of the  Court in his  favour. 
He  must  have  approached  the  Court  with  clean  hands  but  as 
stated  above  that  during  pendency  of  the  Civil  Revision 
No.1402/2015 (which is yet to be adjudicated upon and decided 
finally  as  the  same  was  got  adjourned  sine  die.)  he  filed  the 
application  under  section  12(2)  of  the  Code.  The  intention  of 
law while introducing section 12(2) C.P.C. was in fact to curtail 
the  agony  of  the  parties but unfortunately  it is being used as a 
weapon  to  prolong  the  miseries  of  the  parties.  Petition  under 
section  12(2)  of  the  Code  was  incompetent  in  the  eye  of  law 
when  a  suit  for  declaration  was  already  pending  adjudication 
before  the  civil  Court  and  even  the  plea  taken  up  by  the 
respondent  No.3  in  his  application  under  section  12(2)  of  the 
Code  can  safely  be  pleaded  in  the  already  filed  civil  revision 
No.1402/2015.  
6. 
 
The  respondent  No.3  despite  having  knowledge 
germane to pendency of the above mentioned civil revision set 
the  law  into  motion  by  misguiding  as  well  as  concealing  the 
facts and has wasted the precious time of Courts, not only of the 
learned  trial  Court  and  appellate  Court  but  also  of  this  Court, 
thus,  the  argument  advanced  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondent  No.3  that  statutory  right  of  appeal  being  available 
under  law  cannot  be  denied  merely  because  law  provided 
another remedy and the respondent No.3 could file application 
under section 12(2) of the Code, has no force, especially when 
the  respondent  No.3  had  availed  right  of  appeal  against  the 
judgment  and  decree  dated  16.10.2014,  which  appeal  was 
dismissed  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated  28.03.2015  and 
against  the  said  judgments  and  decrees  civil  revision  No.1402 
W.P.No.38940 of 2016 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            9 
of  2015  was  pending  and  alive,  not  finally  adjudicated  and 
decided.  
7. 
 
Pursuant  to  the  discussion,  the  application  under 
section 12(2) of the Code was not competent and maintainable 
and  has  wrongly  been  filed  by  the  respondent  No.3  and  has 
obtained the impugned orders through concealment of facts. 
8. 
 
The  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned  counsel 
for  the  respondent  No.3  has  no  relevance  to  the  peculiar  facts 
and circumstances of the case in hand; thus, with utmost respect 
to the same, it does not render any assistance or help to his case. 
9. 
 
For 
the  foregoing  reasons, 
the  constitutional 
petition  is  allowed,  impugned  orders  dated  07.04.2015  and 
23.04.2016  passed  by  the  learned  trial  Court  and  learned 
revisional  Court,  respectively  are  set  aside;  the  application 
under section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 filed 
by the respondent No.3 stands dismissed, with costs throughout.
