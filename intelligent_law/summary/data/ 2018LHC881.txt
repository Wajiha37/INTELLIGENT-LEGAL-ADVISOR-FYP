2.  
By  virtue  of  these  Petitions,  filed  under  Article  199  of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”),  the  Petitioners  have  mainly  assailed  order 
dated 24.12.2012 passed by the Respondent No.1 whereby their 
representation was rejected. 
3. 
Brief  facts  of  all  these  Petitions  are  that  the  Petitioners 
earlier  filed  W.P.  No.25967/2012  before  this  Court,  and  the 
matter  was  remitted  to  the  Respondents  for  decision  afresh 
considering  it  as  Representation  of  the  Petitioners.  The 
Respondents  duly  decided  the  same  vide  their  impugned  order 
dated 24.12.2012, which is challenged in this petition.  
4. 
In  reply  to  this  Petition,  the  Respondents  filed  their 
report  and  parawise  comments  denying  all  the  allegations 
levelled in these petitions and praying for dismissal of the same. 
5. 
Mian  Muhammad  Sharif,  learned  counsel  for  the 
Petitioners inter alia submitted that as per law laid down by this 
Court  in  the  order  dated  29.12.1999  as  well  as  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  vide  order  dated  24.11.2010,  the 
employees  completing  more  than  six  (6)  months  of  service 
during  retirement  year  are  entitled    to  one  usual  increment  for 
pension  calculations  purpose;  that  the  non-statutory  Voluntary 
Retirement  Separation  Scheme  (VRSS)  dated  15.11.2000  
passed  and  circulated  without  prior  Government  approval  is 
contrary  to  provision  of  Section  49  of  the  Life  Insurance

Nationalization Order 1972 (the “Order”); that it is settled law 
that  the  benefit  granted  under  the  decision  of  the  Court  to 
litigant  employees  will  be  given  to  all  other  similarly  placed 
non-litigant  employees  without  dragging  them  into  litigation 
ignoring  the  question  of  limitation,  as  such  the  Petitioners  are 
also  entitled  one  annual  increment;  that 
the  State  Life 
Employees Pension Regulations, 1986 (the “Regulations”) will 
in no way be overridden by any administrative order, therefore, 
the  Petitioners’  earlier  retirements  w.e.f.  05.12.2000  under  an 
administrative  order  dated  15.11.2000  are  without  any  legal 
effect; that the impugned order dated 24.12.2012 passed by the 
Respondent  No.1  in  pursuance  of  orders  of  this  Court  in  W.P. 
No.25967/2012  is  totally  against  the  law  and  facts  as  the  said 
Respondent has failed to appreciate the fact that the revised pay 
scales  effective  from  01.01.2000  on  which  date  the  Petitioners 
were  in  service,  will  apply  to  the  Petitioners  who  were  retired 
on 05.12.2000. In support of his contention learned counsel has 
placed reliance on the case titled  I.A. Shariwani and others v. 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Finance Division, 
Islamabad  and  others  (1991  SCMR  1041),  Ch.  Azhar  Ali 
Safeer & others v. The State Life Insurance Corporation etc. 
(Civil Petitions No.591 to 612 & 630 of 2003),

controverted the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the Petitioners and prayed for dismissal of these petitions on the 
grounds that once the Petitioners accepted the VRSS with their 
free  will  and  volition,  the  same  cannot  be    cancelled  and 
withdrawn  as  the  same  was  concluded  contract  between  the 
parties; that these petitions are hit by the principle of laches as 
they are filed after a period of 13 years from the acceptance of 
VRSS  dated  15.11.2000;  that  the  letter  dated  12.02.2001 
whereby the pensionery regulations were amended is altogether 
different issue with respect to the VRSS Policy; that this Court 
as  well  as  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  vide  orders 
dated  15.04.2009  and  09.02.2011  set  aside    the  amendment  of 
regulation due to the reason  that statutory regulations cannot be 
amended through an administrative order, hence the question of 
letter  dated  12.02.2001  has  no  nexus  with  the  present  issue  of 
VRSS; that the questions raised in these petitions have already 
been  decided  by  this  Court  in  W.P.  No.11036/2013  vide  order 
dated  24.01.2014  which  was  upheld  by  the  Hon’ble  Division 
Bench  of  this  Court  in  I.C.A.  No.173/2014  vide  order  dated 
04.03.2014;  that  this  Court  has  also  dismissed  similar  writ 
petitions on the same point.  Learned counsel, to strengthen his 
arguments,  has  placed  reliance  on  the  case  titled  Ms.  Salma 
Moosajee  and  another  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others

the  arguments  advanced  by  Mr.  Jahanzeb  Khan  Bharwana,

The minute read-through of the record reveals that infact 
the Respondents Corporation announced a VRSS on 15.11.2000 
containing  certain  terms  and  conditions.  The  Petitioners  and 
some  other  employees  accepted  the  said  VRSS  and  availed  its 
benefits in terms of their pre-mature retirement. It is pertinent to 
mention  here  that  the  VRSS  was  a  contract  between  the 
Corporation  and  the  Petitioners  and  their  retirement  was  never 
made under the Regulations. But subsequently the Corporation 
revised  the  pension  scheme  by  making  amendment  in  the 
Regulations  which  was  challenged  by  some  of  the  employees 
and was set aside up to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
Meaning  thereby,  that  there  were  two  set  of  employees,  first 
who  accepted  the  VRSS  and  got  their  pre-mature  retirement 
after availing all the benefits of VRSS that were the Petitioners 
(the  “First  Set  of  Employees”)  and  the  second  set  of 
employees  never  availed  the  VRSS  and  retired  under  the 
Regulations and challenged the revised pension scheme in W.P. 
No.9183/2006 (the “Second Set of Employees”). 
10.  During  the course of  arguments, the  much stress laid by 
the learned counsel for the Petitioners is that the Petitioners are 
also liable to be extended benefit of the judgment of Ch. Azhar 
Ali Safeer supra. He reiterated and re-read the last paragraph of 
the  said  judgment.  I  have  gone  through  the  whole  judgment. 
None  else  but  the  Petitioners  themselves  relied  upon  the  said

judgment  of  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan.  I  would 
like  to  reproduce  the  relevant  paragraphs  of  the  said  judgment 
which reads as follows: 
“9.  We  have 
listened 
to 
the  arguments 
extensively  but  do  not  feel  inclined  to  agree 
therewith.  It  would  be  appropriate  to  refer  to 
various  dates  involved.  The  VRS  Scheme  was 
introduced  on  15.11.2000.  The  Petitioners 
volunteered  for  the  Scheme  before  28.11.2000, 
their  options  were  accepted  on  01.12.2000  and 
consequently  they  were  relieved  on  05.12.2000. 
They also opted on 13.12.2000 that they would not 
claim  new  pay  scales.  It  was  about  two  months 
thereafter  on  12.02.2001  that  fresh  pay  scales 
were announced for the remaining employees who 
had  not  opted  for  the  VRS  Scheme.  As  the 
Petitioners  exercised  their  voluntary  option  much 
before getting knowledge of the confidential letter, 
they  cannot  be  justified  in  their  claim  that  the 
option  was  obtained  either  through  fraud  or 
through  misrepresentation.  The  learned  counsel 
admitted at the bar that the confidential letter had 
come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Petitioners  much 
subsequent  to  the  date  when  the  Petitioners  were 
relieved  and  the  Scheme  had  been  finalized.    We 
are convinced that it was not a case where options 
were obtained either through misrepresentation of 
by fraud.

12.  The  learned  Tribunal  rightly  held  and 
accepted  the  appeals  to  such  extent  because  this 
claim, to the detriment of the employees, could not 
be  enforced  retrospectively.  They  were  entitled  to 
the same pensionery benefits as were admissible to 
them  under  the  rules  in  force  till  11.02.2001.  As 
the denial of pensionery benefits provide recurring 
cause  of  action,  the  limitation  also  was  rightly 
ignored  by  the  learned  Tribunal.  Civil  Petition 
No.630/2003,  filed  by  the  State  Life  Insurance 
Corporation 
in 
this  behalf  also  deserves 
dismissal.”    
         
 
11.  From the above reproduced paragraphs, it is unequivocal 
that  in  paragraph  9  of  the  judgment,  the  case  of  the 
Petitioners/First  Set  of  Employees,  as  alleged  in  the  instant 
petitions, has been discussed  whereas in  the  last paragraph  i.e. 
12,  the  case  of  employees  who  fall  in  the  category  of  the 
Second  Set  of  Employees  has  been  discussed.  Therefore,  the 
Petitioners/First Set of Employees, cannot be allowed to mingle 
their case with the case of  Second Set of Employees. As such, 
the  Petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  the  benefit  extended  in  the 
above said judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
to the Second Set of Employees being distinguishable from the 
present  Petitioners.  In  this  view  of  the  situation,  I  feel  no 
hesitation  to  hold  that  the  Petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  the 
same  benefit  as  granted  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of

Pakistan  in  the  above  said  judgment  to  the  Second  Set  of 
Employees.  Consequently, 
the 
last  paragraph  12 
is  not 
applicable  to  the  case  of  the  Petitioners  rather  paragraph  9  of 
the  judgment  is  duly  attracted.  Furthermore,  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  Chairman  State  Life 
Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan,  State  Life  Building 
Karachi. V. Noor  Ahmed and others (Civil Appeal No.23-K 
of 2011) has also discussed the Ch. Azhar Ali Safeer case supra 
in the following  manner: 
“We have heard the learned counsel for the parties 
and have perused the record. From the perusal of 
the  record,  it  appears  that  the  Appellant  vide 
Notification  dated  12.02.2001  revised  the  pay 
structure  and  fringe  benefits  for  the  officers  who 
were  in  service  on  31.12.2000.  Admittedly  on  the 
said date none of the Respondents were in service 
of  the  Appellant  and  as  such  benefit  under  the 
revised  pay  structure  cannot  be  extended  to  them 
which was calculated by the Appellant on the basis 
of 
the  employees  who  were 
in  service  on 
31.12.2000.  By  a  three  Members  Bench  of  this 
Court,  in  the  case  of  Ch.  Azhar  Ali  Safeer  and 
others 
versus  The  State  Life 
Insurance 
Corporation,  etc.    (Civil  Petition  No.591  to  612 
and  630  of  2003),  while  dealing  with  the  same 
question involved in present case, in respect of the 
employees  of  the  Appellant  Corporation  held  that 
the benefit of Notification dated 12.02.2001 cannot

be extended to the employees, who were not on the 
role of the Corporation on 31.12.2000.”    
12.  On  the  other  hand,  I  am  fully  convinced  with  the 
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the Respondents 
that  this  Court  in  the  similar  case  (W.P.11036/2013)  has 
dismissed  the  claim  of  the  Petitioners  which  has  been  duly 
upheld  by  the  Hon’ble  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  in  I.C.A. 
No.173/2014. The relevant portion of the W.P. No.11036/2013 
is reproduced below for ready reference and is as follows: 
“The entire case of the Petitioners is based  on the 
fact  that  the  VRSS  had  to  be  approved  by  the 
Federal  Government  as  was  held  in  the  order  of 
this Court dated 15.04.2009 in W.P. No.9183/2006 
which  was  upheld  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
of  Pakistan  in  its  judgment  dated  09.02.2011  in 
Civil Appeal No.528-L/2009. A bare review of the 
judgment  of  this  Court  alongwith  the  judgment  of 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan shows that 
it  is  based  on  totally  different  issues.    The  case 
relied  upon by learned counsel for the Petitioners 
is based on an amendment made in the Regulations 
of  1986 
 
through  an  administrative  order, 
therefore, 
in 
that  case 
it  was  held 
that 
administrative  orders  cannot  amend  statutory 
regulations.  In  the  instant  cases,  the  Petitioners 
entered  into  a  contractual  arrangement  with  the 
Respondents  on  the  basis  of  the  VRSS.  The  VRSS 
was  offered  through  circular  No.Ref:PL-10(2)  on 
11 
W.P No.2096/2013

W.P. No.2099/2013 
W.P. No.10549/2013 
 
15.11.2000.  It  provided  that  once  the  VRSS  was 
exercised  it  could  not  be  cancelled/  revoked/ 
withdrawn  or  changed  by  the  staff  members.  The 
Petitioners  agreed  to  their  premature  retirement 
on  the  terms  and  conditions  offered  under  the 
VRSS. In such a situation, there was no reason for 
the  VRSS 
to  be  approved  by 
the  Federal 
Government  as  it  was  not  a  retirement  under  the 
Regulations  of  1986  but  in  fact  it  was  an  offer 
made  by  the  Respondents  to  their  employees  to 
accept  monetary  benefits  against  a  premature 
retirement.  The  Petitioners  have  all  accepted  the 
terms and conditions of the VRSS and they availed 
all  their  benefits.  There  is  no  correlation  in  the 
instant cases with the judgments relied upon by the 
learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioners.  Furthermore, 
it is noted that these petitions have been filed after 
a  period  of  more  than  13  years  and  during  this 
period the Petitioners never objected or raised any 
objection  against  the  VRSS  and  the  amounts  paid 
there-under. 
7. 
Under 
the  circumstances,  no  case 
for 
interference is made out. Petitions are dismissed.   
 
Similarly,  in  the  I.C.A.  No.173/2014  the  Hon’ble  Division 
Bench of this Court has held as under: 
“It is admitted position that the Appellant accepted 
the  VRSS  Scheme  in  the  year  2000  and  opted  for 
retirement and also took all benefits under the said 
scheme.  The  said  VRSS  scheme  is  neither  arising 
out  of  the  Regulations  nor  has  any  statutory

backing,  therefore,  there  was  no  requirement  for 
the approval of the Federal Government  u/s 49 of 
the  State  Life  Insurance  Nationalization  Order, 
1972  (“Order  1972”).  The  VRSS  Scheme  was  a 
contractual  arrangement  between  the  Appellant 
and  the  Respondents.  The  said  VRSS  scheme  was 
offered 
through  Circular  No.Ref:PL-10(2)  on 
15.11.2000,  according  to  which  once  the  VRSS 
scheme  was 
exercised, 
it 
could  not  be 
cancelled/revoked/withdrawn  or  changed  by  the 
staff  members.  The  Appellants  accepted  the  said 
VRSS scheme and agreed to proceed on premature 
retirement  availing  all  the  benefits  as  per  terms 
and conditions under the VRSS scheme.”   
 
13.  In  Bilal  Akhtar  and  others  vs.  President/Chief  Executive 
Officer  and  6  others,  (2017  PLC  (C.S.)  564  (Lahore)),  the 
employees  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Company  Limited 
retired  under  voluntary  separation  scheme  sought  direction  for 
increase  in  the  benefit  of  anomaly.  This  Court  held  that  the 
Voluntary separation scheme was optional for the petitioners to 
accept the same or otherwise. The petitioners having exercised 
option to retire from service on and from cutoff date, could not 
be treated at par with the employees who did not exercise such 
option.  Employees  were  paid  emoluments  in  full  and  final  for 
the  period  they  worked  after  they  had  opted  for  retirement 
under  voluntary  separation  scheme  they  had  received  benefits 
accordingly.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  scheme  were

circulated amongst all the employees. The terms and conditions 
of scheme were opted by the petitioners/employees voluntarily 
without any coercion or duress. The petitioner/employees after 
signing  and  thumb  marking  acknowledged  and  accepted  the 
terms  and  conditions  of  the  scheme.  The  office  letters  had 
specified the amount to be received and same constituted to be 
full  and  final  amount  under  voluntary  separation  scheme.  The 
petitioners/employees after accepting the said amount could not 
turn around and seek additional benefits. Nothing was on record 
that scheme had been executed by the employees under duress 
or coercion rather they had received full and final payment after 
accepting  the  same  voluntarily.  The  employees  were  estopped 
from challenging/questioning the terms of voluntary separation 
scheme,  and  the  constitutional  petition  was  dismissed  in 
circumstances. 
14.  Moreover,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 
case titled Muhammad Rafiullah and others v. Zarai Taraqiati 
Bank  Limited  (ZTBL)  through  President,  Islamabad  and 
another (2018 SCMR 598) has held as under: 
“Where  an  employee  voluntarily  accepted  and 
received benefits under some arrangement with the 
employer out of his own free will then he could not 
turn around and seek benefits that were ordinarily 
applicable to other employees”

It is further added that on the issue of laches the Hon’ble 
Division Bench of this Court in the earlier round of litigation on 
the  same  issue  in  case  titled  Muhammad  Yasin  v.  State  Life 
Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan  etc.  (I.C.A. No.161/2014) 
has already given its view that the Appeal is hit by laches. The 
Appellants have approached the Court after a lapse of 13 years 
and that too after fully enjoying the benefits under the Scheme. 
No  reason  has  been  given  for  the  said  delay.  Reliance  in  this 
regard can be placed on the case titled State Bank of Pakistan 
through Governor and another v. Imtiaz Ali Khan and others 
(2012 PLC (C.S.) 218) in which the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under: 
“Laches  is  a  doctrine  whereunder  a  party  which 
may  have  a 
right,  which  was  otherwise 
enforceable,  loses  such  right  to  the  extent  of  its 
enforcement, if it is found by the court of a law that 
its  case  is  hit  by  the  doctrine  of  laches/limitation. 
Right  remains  with  the  party,  but  he  cannot 
enforce  it.  The  limitation  is  examined  by  the 
Limitation Act, 1908 or by special laws which have 
inbuilt  provisions  for  seeking  relief  against  any 
grievance  within  the  time  specified  under  the  law 
and  if  party  aggrieved  does  not  approach  the 
appropriate 
forum  within 
the 
stipulated 
period/time,  the  grievance  though  remains,  but  it 
cannot  be  redressed  because  if  on  the  one  hand 
there was a right with a party which he could have

enforced  against 
the  other,  but  because  of 
principle  of  limitation/laches,  same  right  then 
vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party.” 
16.  From the above situation, it is evident that the Petitioner 
after twelve years filed the writ petition before this Court and in 
pursuance of which the Respondent No.1 passed the impugned 
order on 24.12.2012 which has been assailed by the Petitioners 
in the  instant  writ petition. Furthermore,  there is no doubt  that 
the  case  of  the  Petitioners  which  has  been  agitated  before  this 
Court in the instant petitions has already been dealt with up-till 
the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan.  The  judgments  relied 
upon  by 
the 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  Petitioners  are 
distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the present 
cases,  as  such  cannot  be  relied  upon.  Furthermore,  the  learned 
counsel for the Petitioners has failed to point out any illegality 
or perversity in the impugned order dated 24.12.2012 which has 
been passed by the Respondent No.1 strictly in accordance with 
law and does not call for any interference by this Court.     
17. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the Petitioners 
are  not  entitled  to  the  claims  sought  for  in  these  petitions. 
Therefore, these petitions stand dismissed.
