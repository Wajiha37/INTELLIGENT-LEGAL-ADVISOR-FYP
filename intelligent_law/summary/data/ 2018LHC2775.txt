12.11.2018  Malik Muhammad Arshad Kundi, Advocate for the  
 
 
petitioner. 
 
 
Through  the  instant  petition,  the  petitioner  seeks 
recovery of her son, namely Ali Sher aged about 10 days 
from 
the 
illegal  confinement  of  respondent  No.4 
Muhammad Shahid father of the minor.  
 
2. 
In compliance of order dated 08.11.2018 passed by 
this  Court,  SHO-respondent  No.2  produced  minor 
alongwith  his  father  respondent  No.4,  who  admits  that 
the age of minor is about 13 days.  
 
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that 
soon after the birth of minor, he has been snatched from 
the  mother  and  she  was  forced  to  live  in  her  parentsâ€™ 
home.  
 
4. 
Admittedly, the minor is a suckling baby of about 
13  days.  It  has  consistently  been  held  by  the  august 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  its  various  judgments 
reported  as  Mst.  Nadia  Perveen  v.  Mst.  Almas  Noreen 
and  others  (PLD  2012  Supreme  Court  758),  Muhammad 
Javed Umrao v. Miss. Uzma Vahid (1988 SCMR 1891), 
Nasir Muhammad and another v. Sultan Zari (PLD 1997 
SC  852),  Mst.  Khalida  Perveen  v.  Muhammad  Sultan 
 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.248023-H of 2018                                                                                      2 
 
 
Mehmood  and  another  (PLD  2004  SC  1)  and  Naziha 
Ghzali v. The State and another (2001 SCMR 1782) that 
the  matter  of  custody  of  minor  children  can  be  brought 
before a High Court under section 491 Cr.P.C. only if;-  
 
1) 
2) 
 
3) 
The child is of very tender age. 
He  has  quite  recently  been  snatched  away 
from lawful custody and,  
There is a real urgency in the matter. 
 
But  obviously  the  High  Court  may  only  regulate  the 
interim custody of the children leaving the matter of final 
custody to be determined by the learned Guardian Court.  
 
5. 
Keeping  in  view  the  above  circumstances,  since 
the  minor  is  a  suckling  baby  aged  about  13  days,  the 
mother has been deprived from the custody of minor few 
days  ago,  and  there  is  a  real  urgency  in  the  matter,  so, 
this Court while exercising powers u/s 491 Cr.P.C. order 
to hand over the custody of minor Ali Sher to his mother 
immediately.  Anyhow,  respondent  No.4  Muhammad 
Shahif father, would be at liberty to approach the learned 
Guardian Court for regularization of custody of minor.  
 
6. 
In  view  of  above  discussion,  instant  petition  is 
allowed in the above terms.
