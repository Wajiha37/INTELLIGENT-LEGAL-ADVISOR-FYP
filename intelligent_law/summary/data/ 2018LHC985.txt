petitioners  of  Writ  Petition  No.176056/2018  shall  be  referred 
hereinafter as “respondents / allottees”. 
 
Brief  consolidated  facts  of  the  above  Intra  Court  Appeal  as 
well as both the writ petitions are that evacuee land measuring 253-
Kanals 04-Marlas comprising Khasra Nos.1425 to 1431-1435, 1477 
to  1485  and  1488  to  1517  situated  in  Mauza  Harbanspura,  District 
Lahore  was  transferred  to  Services  General  Administration  & 
Information  Department  (Information,  Culture  &  Tourism)  for  the 
construction  of  tourist  village  within  5  years  vide  Memorandum 
No.360-86-1/805-CS  dated  16.03.1986.  After  expiry  of  said  five 
years,  Managing  Director,  TDCP, intimated, officer on special  duty 
BOR  vide  TDCP/DM(P&D)/93/117  dated  27.05.1993  that  the 
earmarked land is no more required as the tourist village has already 
been established within Jallo Park. 
 
Nawabzada  Walayat  Ali  Khan  obtained  allotment  of  land 
measuring 25-Kanals 06-Marlas comprising Khasra Nos.1488, 1493 
and  1494  situated  in  Mauza  Harbanspura  against  his  unadjusted 
urban  claim  of  258  PIUs  vide order dated  03.05.1992  and  mutation 
No.10445 was sanctioned in favour of allottee on 24.06.1993 which 
allotment  was  challenged  by  one  Rafaqat  Ali  through  Writ  Petition 
No.45-R/1995 which petition stood dismissed by this Court, whereas 
Assistant  Commissioner,  Tehsil  Lahore  Cantt.  Initiated  review 
proceeding and finally cancelled the above mutation on 21.03.1995. 
The  aggrieved  allottee  challenged  the  said  order  of  Assistant

Commissioner  before  Notified  Officer  on  19.03.2003  which  met 
with  dismissal  on  24.02.2016.  The  allottee  filed  application  before 
Commissioner  for  restoration  of  said  mutation  which  was  accepted 
by ADCG Cantt. vide order dated 18.06.2016 and order of Assistant 
Commissioner  dated  21.03.1995  was  set  aside  and  mutation 
No.10445 was restored on 22.08.2016 in the revenue record. 
 
Contemporaneously  Rafaqat  Ali  being  in  possession  of  land 
filed  application  for  the  allotment  of  land  measuring  84-Kanals 
including the land  bearing  Khasra  No.1488, 1493  and  1494  already 
allotted  to  the  respondent  allottee,  which  application  was  dismissed 
by  the  Notified  Officer.  Feeling  aggrieved,  he  filed  Writ  Petition 
No.103-R/1995  which  was  accepted  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated 
11.07.1995.  After  acceptance  of  the  writ  petition,  said  Rafaqat  Ali 
sold out the possessory right of the land in large number of pieces to 
different  persons.  The  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  challenged 
the  order  of  this  Court  through  filing  Civil  Appeal  No.969/1996 
which  was  accepted  by  the  August  Supreme  Court  vide  judgment 
dated  22.04.1998  (reported  as  1998  SCMR  2596)  holding  that  the 
land  be  disposed  of  under  the  Scheme  for  the  Management  & 
Disposal  of  Available  Urban  Properties,  1977.  Rafaqat  Ali  &  28 
others again filed applications on 07.12.2007 to the Senior Member, 
Board  of  Revenue  for  the  purchase  of  the  evacuee  land  under  the 
Scheme  1977,  whereas  the  Managing  Director,  TDCP,  Punjab  vide 
letter No.PS/MD/TDCP/09/170 dated 06.06.2009 reported that 203-

Kanals  land  has  been  occupied  by  encroachers.  On  the  said 
information, 
the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner 
floated 
advertisement  in  newspapers  requiring  all  the  illegal  occupants  to 
appear before him on 20.11.2009. Only, Ch. Ayyaz Imran & 8 others 
appeared  and  asserted  that  they  are  subsequent  vendees  from  said 
Rafaqat Ali since 1995 and have raised Pacca construction over the 
said  land.  They  filed  application  on  20.11.2009  for  the  purchase  of 
the  land  in  their  possession  through  private  treaty  at  market  price. 
The  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  /  Administrator  (Residual 
Properties)  allowed  the  sale  of  said  land  already  allotted  to 
respondent No.10 (the allottee) to the illegal occupant at the market 
price  plus  +  50%  penalty  vide  order  dated  09.07.2010.  The 
subsequent  sitting  occupant  filed  Writ  Petition  No.206/2010  which 
was  allowed  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated  30.09.2011  and 
imposition  of  penalty  of  50%  was  set  aside.  Hence,  the  captioned 
ICA as well as Writ Petitions.  
4.  Mr.Mahmood A. Sheikh,Advocate submitted that order of the 
learned Single Judge in Chamber dated 30.09.2011 is illegal and not 
sustainable  in  the  eye  of  law.  He  further  submits  that  after  Repeal 
Act, 1975, the Notified Officer was not competent to allot the urban 
land,  building  site,  land  against  the  unadjusted  PIU  Units  and 
verbally  prayed  for  reversal  of  order  dated  03.05.1992  and 
24.06.1993 of the Notified Officer.

Mr.  Muhammad  Shahzad  Shaukat,  Advocate  appearing  on 
behalf  of  respondents  occupants  submits  that  after  the  Repeal  of 
Evacuee Laws, land could not be allotted against any pending claims 
of  unadjusted  unsatisfied  PIUs,  within  the  urban  limits  of  District 
Lahore;  that  all  the  available  evacuee  land  can  only  be  disposed  of 
through  the  Scheme  for  the  Management  &  Disposal  of  Available 
Urban Properties, 1977; that the Notified Officer / Member (Residual 
Properties),  Board  of  Revenue,  Punjab,  Lahore  in  contravention  of 
the  Scheme  mentioned  hereinabove  has  illegally  and  unlawfully 
allotted  the  urban  evacuee  land  to  “allottee”  respondent  No.10,  as 
such,  orders  dated  03.05.1992,  4.06.1993,  18.06.2010  and 
22.08.2016 are liable to be set aside being illegal and passed without 
lawful authority. 
 
Mr.  Aamir  Zahoor  Chohan,  Advocate/learned  counsel 
appearing  on  behalf  of  the  legal  heirs  of  Nawabzada  Walayat  Ali 
Khan,  respondents  No.10(i)  to  10(vi)  “allottee”  submits  that  the 
Chief Settlement Commissioner vide order dated 24.06.1993 allotted 
urban  agricultural 
land  measuring  25-Kanals  06-Marlas 
in 
Harbanspura, Lahore to the allottees (respondent No.10 (i) to 10(vi)) 
against 228 PI Units, which order is still in field; further submits that 
the  order  dated  09.07.2010  in  favour  of  Ch.  Ayyaz  Imran  etc. 
“occupants”  is  illegal  as  said  occupant  claimed  to  be  purchasers  of 
the  land  measuring  64-Kanals  03-Marlas  from  Rafaqat  Ali  in  1995 
whereas the said vendor has lost his claim upto the Hon‟ble Supreme

Court of Pakistan and they are not entitled to purchase the said land; 
learned  Member  (Residual  Properties)  /  Notified  Officer  was  not 
competent  to  sell  the  land  to  the  illegal  occupants  as  per  Scheme 
1977;  further  submits  that  property  has  already  been  allotted  to 
claimant  allottee  and  was  not  available  in  pool  for  disposal  of  land 
since  1992;  further  submitted  that  neither  allottees  were  arrayed  as 
party  in  the  proceeding  before  the  Member  nor  they  were  heard 
before passing the order of sale to the sitting occupants and allottee 
has  been  condemned  unheard;  and  finally  prayed  for  dismissal  of 
Writ  Petition  No.39990/2016  and  setting  aside  order  dated 
09.07.2010 passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner.  
5.  We  have  heard  the  arguments  of  learned  counsels  for  the 
parties and gone through the record with their able assistance. 
6. 
As  the  main  controversy  in  the  instant  matter  is  centered 
around  the  allotment  as  well  as  sale  of  the  evacuee  properties 
situated  in  Mauza  Harbanspura  within  the  urban  limits  of  District 
Lahore. The pivotal points for determination before this Court are as 
under:- 
(1)  whether  after  issue  of  Notification  dated  16.05.1973  by 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  declaring  all  the  property 
(including  urban  agricultural  land)  as  building  site  and  with 
promulgation  of the Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons 
Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975, the Notified Officer was competent 
to make fresh allotment against unsatisfied urban units;  
(2)  whether  the  Member  (Residual  Properties)  has  the 
jurisdiction to order for the sale of urban evacuee / state land 
to  the  encroachers,  illegal  occupants  who  were  not  in 
possession of evacuee state land on 01.01.1976?

Now  dilating  upon  the  first  point,  it  is  quite  appropriate  to  briefly 
recapitulate  the  legal  scheme  of  rehabilitation  of  the  evacuee. 
Admittedly,  after  partition  of  India  in  1947  for  the  rehabilitation  of 
the migrants the allotments of evacuee land were being made to the 
evacuee  claimant  against  their  claim  under  different  schemes  and 
notification  on  the  subject  as  well  as  under  the  Displaced  Persons 
(Compensation  and  Rehabilitation)  Act,  1958.  Numerous  complaint 
regarding the bogus claims and fake allotment received to the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner who in order  to curb fraudulent allotment 
issued  a  notification  dated  16.05.1973  declaring  all  the  evacuee 
urban  lands  situated  within  the  urban  limits  of  a  Municipal 
Corporation, Municipal Committee, Notified Area Committee, Town 
Area  Committee,  Small  Town  Committee  and  Sanitary  Committee, 
or a Cantonment, throughout the Province of the Punjab, as building 
sites and a complete ban was imposed on the allotment of such lands. 
The  above  notification  was  ultimately  validated  by  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case  reported  as  Muhammad 
Ramzan  &  Others  Vs.  Member  (Rev.)/CSS  &  Others  (1997  SCMR 
1635).  Further, all  the  evacuee laws  were  also  repealed through  the 
Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975 
with effect from Ist July 1974 and further allotment of evacuee lands 
against  any  claim  were  banned  and  a  limited  jurisdiction  was 
conferred  upon  the  notified  officer  under  Section  2  (2)  of  the 
Repealing  Act,  1975  to  dispose  of  only  the  active  pending

proceedings  or  the  matters  remanded  by  the  High  Court  or  by  the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. For ready reference Section 2 (2) of the 
Act ibid. is reproduced as under:-  
Repeal  of  certain  Laws.-(2)  Upon  the  repeal  of  the 
“2. 
aforesaid  Acts  and  Regulations,  all  proceedings  which, 
immediately  before  such  repeal,  may  be  pending  before  the 
authorities  appointed  thereunder  shall  stand  transferred  for  final 
disposal  to  such  officers  as  may  be  notified  by  the  Provincial 
Government  in  the  official  Gazette  and  all  cases  decided  by  the 
Supreme  Court  or  a  High  Court  after  such  repeal  which  would 
have been remanded to any such authority in the absence of such 
repeal shall be remanded to the, officers notified as aforesaid.”  
The pending proceedings means only those proceedings which 
were immediately pending before 01.07.1974 or the cases decided by 
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court or High Court. The Hon‟ble Supreme of 
Pakistan in respect of the same preposition has laid down in the case 
reported  as  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  /  Member,  Board  of 
Revenue (S&R Wing), Punjab, Lahore Vs. Akhtar Munir & 6 Others 
(PLD 2003 SC 603) as under:- 
in 
the  office  of 
“The facts leading to the filing of Writ Petition No.52-R of 1984 
were that claim of the respondents were duly verified in District 
Rawalpindi  but  instead  of  getting  the  same  settled  in  District 
Rawalpindi the respondents sought their transfer to Lahore on the 
ground that they had shifted to Lahore. The verified claims were 
allegedly  misplaced  either 
the  Deputy 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi or Lahore in transit. The respondents 
have  not  cared  to  contest  the  appeal  and  it  appears  from  the 
record  that  they  had  for  the  first  time  moved  an  application  on 
26-2-1976  with  regard  to  the  whereabouts  of  their  claims  as  a 
result  of  which  a  duplicate  entitlement  certificate  was  issued  on 
22-11-1976. The case thus cannot be said to be actively pending 
consideration  before  the  authorities  concerned  for  final  disposal 
within the contemplation of the principle enunciated in Zafar Ali 
Khan  v.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  (1999  SCMR  1719). 
The  conceding  statement  of 
the 
department  can  have  no  bearing  on  the  case  in  view  of  the 
observations  made 
in  Muhammad  Ramzan  v.  Member 
(Revenue)/CSS 
that  disposal  of 
constitutional  petition  by  the  High  Court  based  on  illegal  and 
tainted concession of Settlement  Department  is  devoid  of lawful 
authority  and  subsequent  direction  for  its  implementation  is 
equally coram non judice and as such has no binding effect. The 
(1997  SCMR  1635) 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
 
I.C.A. No.638/2011 
W.P. No.39990/2016 
W.P. No.176056/2018 
 
 
10 
judgment dated 4-12-1991 vis-à-vis this petition thus suffers from 
a jurisdictional defect and there is force in the contention that it is 
void ab initio being coram non judice.” 
Further, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has defined pending 
proceedings  in  a  case  reported  as  Government  of  Punjab,  Colonies 
Department,  Lahore  &  Others  Vs.  Muhammad  Yaqoob  (PLD  2002 
SC 5) which is as under:- 
“The  term  “pending  proceedings”  as  used  in  these  laws  would 
mean  that  an  initial  step  taken  as  contemplated  under  the 
settlement laws for allotment of land against verified claim of the 
claimants  but  the  same  did  not  finalize  before  the  repeal  of  the 
same,  therefore,  it  was  with  reference  to  such  cases  that  it  was 
provided that those would be taken forward and concluded under 
the repealed settlement laws as if they had not been repealed for 
the  said  limited  purpose  and  in  order  to  pass  final  order  in  such 
cases a provision was made to appoint a Notified Officer to deal 
with such cases. Mere possession of any evacuee land as claimed 
by the respondent in Chak No.223/RB in the writ petition would 
not  make  his  case,  a  case  of  pending  proceedings  within  the 
contemplation  of  provisions  of  sections  2  and  3  of  the  Evacuee 
Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975, 
therefore,  the  direction  issued  by  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High 
Court for allotment of the said land under the settlement laws to 
the  respondent  was  violative  of  law  which  could  not  have  been 
given,  for  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution, the  High  Court 
could direct a person performing functions in connection with the 
affairs of the Federal Government to do what law requires him to 
do  whereas  the  direction  issued  in  this  case  was  to  the  contrary 
i.e., what law did not require him to do, he was ordered to do.” 
Furthermore, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in another case 
reported  as  Nawabzada  Zafar  Ali  Khan  and  Others  Vs.  Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner/Member,  Board  of  Revenue,  Punjab, 
Lahore  and  Others  (1999  SCMR  1719)  decided  that  the  matters 
which  were  either  actively  pending  consideration  before  the 
Authorities  for  final  disposal  or  had  been  remanded  by  the  High 
Court  or  Supreme  Court  were  to  be  finalized  by  the  “Notified 
Officers” and held as under:- 
 
I.C.A. No.638/2011 
W.P. No.39990/2016 
W.P. No.176056/2018

“30.  Bare perusal of above provisions would disclose that only 
such  matters  which  were  either  actively  pending  consideration 
before Authorities for final disposal or had been remanded by the 
High  Court  or  Supreme  Court  were  to  be  finalized  by  the 
“Notified  Officer”.  The  Settlement  or  Rehabilitation  Authorities 
by express positive assertion have no jurisdiction to entertain any 
fresh  petition  or  representation.  In  the  present  case  undisputedly 
question of entitlement concerning agricultural property left over 
by  Nawab  Faiz  Ali  Khan  in  Patiala  State  was  neither  remanded 
by  this  Court  in  the  above  judgment,  dated  19th  July,  1962,  nor 
any  such  directions  were  made  by  the  High  Court  while 
dismissing the Petition No.121-R of 1989 on 11-2-1990, whereby 
notified  officer  on  its  strength  could  commence  proceedings. 
Therefore,  any  petition  or  representation  filed  by  the  petitioners 
with  regard  to  matter  which  otherwise  legitimate  claim,  same 
under  the  law  could  not  be  entertained  by  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner  or  Notified  Officer  or  any  other  Settlement 
Authority  by  virtue  of  „The  Repealing  Act‟.  Therefore, 
proceedings  drawn  by  Settlement  Commissioner  which 
culminated  in  passing  of  order,  dated  26-2-1992  were  devoid  of 
lawful  authority  and  deemed  to  have  no  legal  effect.  Therefore, 
on the established principle of law entire edifice constructed over 
it shall automatically crumble and fall to the ground.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case reported as Ali Muhammad 
through LRs & Others Vs. Chief Settlement Commissioner & Others 
(2001 SCMR 1822). 
“41. 
In  view  of  the  aforesaid  discussion  we  are  persuaded  to 
hold  that  the  cases  of  the  private  parties  are  not  covered  by  the 
expression  “pending  proceedings”  in  terms  of  section  2(2)  of 
Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act, 
1975, therefore, they have no legitimate cause for transfer of the 
agricultural  land  situated  around  Faisalabad.  Moreover,  no  land 
was available for transfer being evacuee agricultural land in view 
of the Notifications, dated 3rd January, 1958 and 16th May, 1973 
issued  by  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  respectively.  The 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner/Notified  Authority  had  no 
jurisdiction/lawful  authority  to  make  the  allotments  in  favour  of 
private  parties  treating  their  cases  to  be  pending.  Similarly 
respondent  Muhammad  Waris  and  other  whose  case  was 
discussed at length was not entitled for transfer of the property in 
his  favour  because  admittedly  their  claim  was  allegedly  verified 
on  26th  January,  1991  much  after 
repeal  of  evacuee 
laws/regulations  by  Act  of  1975.  As  far  as  intervenors  are 
concerned they may approach the concerned department in view 
of the observations of the High Court in Civil Revision No.1062-
D of 1987, decided on 18-6-1990 and Writ Petitions Nos.2-R of 
1989 and others decided on 20th June, 1990 for redressal of their 
grievance. 
As a result of above conclusion Civil Appeals Nos.170 to 
 
176,  185  and  1561  to  1566  of  1999  are  dismissed  with  costs.

Whereas Civil Appeals Nos.177 to 184 of 1999 are allowed with 
costs,  as  a  consequence  whereof  the  impugned  orders  operating 
against the appellants passed by High Court and Chief Settlement 
Commissioner  /  Notified  Authority  are  declared  as  of  no  legal 
effect.” 
Even otherwise, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
latest  judgment  reported  as  Member  Board  of  Revenue/Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab,  Lahore  Vs.  Abdul  Majeed  & 
Another  (PLD  2015  SC  166)  has  conclusively  held  that  the  Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner  /  Notified  Officer  is  not  competent  to 
make any fresh or any alternate allotment of land to person in lieu of 
any  belated  claim.  It  was  finally  observed  that  only  the  actively 
pending matter shall be treated as pending proceedings or the matter 
which  are  recommended  by  High  Court  and  Supreme  Court  cases 
within  the  ambit  of  the  pending  proceeding.  Moreover,  after 
promulgation  of  Repeal  Act,  1975,  all  the  evacuee  properties,  both 
urban  or  rural,  including  agricultural  stood  transferred  to  the 
Province  against 
the  paid  consideration  and 
the  Provincial 
Government  has  been  empowered  to  dispose  of  the  same  through 
respective urban and rural schemes. Whereas, from the plain reading 
of  the  above  provision  of  law,  it  evinces  that  Notified  Officer  was 
empowered  only  to  dispose  of  pending  proceeding  or  the  matter 
remanded back by this Court or the Hon‟ble Supreme Court.

Now  coming  to  the  instant  lis  relating  to  Writ  Petition 
No.39990/2016,  where  the  allotment  of  Nawabzada  Walayat  Ali 
Khan  /  respondent  No.1  (allottee)  has  been  challenged.  Admittedly

he  obtained  allotment  of  urban  agricultural  land  measuring  28-
Kanals  08-Marlas  in  District  Gujranwala  against  his  urban  verified 
claim  No.9211  for  258  PIUs  but  said  allotment  was  challenged  in 
Writ  Petition  No.667-R/1969  which  allotment  was  set  aside  by  this 
Court  vide  judgment  dated  14.03.1974.  Feeling  aggrieved  by  order 
of  this  Court,  he  challenged  the  same  through  Civil  Appeal 
No.215/1976 and the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan  dismissed 
the  said  appeal  vide  judgment  dated  07.09.1987.  After  having  lost 
the cause, respondent No.1‟s allottee / claimant filed application for 
the  allotment  of  alternate  evacuee  land  against  258  PIU  urban 
agricultural  units.  The 
then  Secretary 
(Revenue)/Settlement 
Commissioner  (Land)/Notified  Officer,  Punjab  vide  order  dated 
30.05.1992 declared his  claim  as  pending  proceeding under  Section 
2 (2) of the Act 1975 and allotted urban agricultural land measuring 
25-Kanals  06-Marlas  bearing  Khasra  Nos.1488,  1493  and  1494  in 
Mauza Harbanspura, Tehsil Cantt., District Lahore to respondent No. 
10, which allotment was implemented in the revenue record through 
registered  mutation  No.10445  on  24.06.1993  and  same  was 
sanctioned 05.07.1993. It is quiet pertinent to mention here that since 
the  allotment  of  the  land  on  30.05.1992  neither  the  respondent 
allottee  obtained  the  possession  till  date  nor  moved  any  application 
in 
this 
regard.  Moreover,  Assistant  Commissioner 
initiated 
proceeding  of  review  and  finally  cancelled  the  mutation  No.10445 
vide  order  dated  31.05.1995  and  land  was  restored  in  the  name  of

provincial  government  whereas  the  said  land  remained  under  the 
possession  of  the  illegal  encroacher  who  succeeded  in  obtain  order 
dated 09.07.2010 for the purchase of said land through private treaty 
at  market  rate.  Admittedly,  the  evacuee  laws  were  repealed  w.e.f. 
01.07.1974  and 
the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  vide 
Notification  dated  16.05.1973  declared  the  land  in  question  as 
building site which could not be allotted against PIUs after repealed 
laws  and  notified  officer  was  vested  with  no  jurisdiction  to  allot  or 
transfer  land  or  grant  alternate  land  after  repealed  evacuee  laws. 
Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases  reported  as  Muhammad  Ramzan  & 
Others  Vs.  Member  (Revenue)  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  & 
Others  (1997  SCMR  1635)  and  Ali  Muhammad  through  LRs  & 
Others  Vs.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  &  Others  (2001  SCMR 
1822). Further reliance is also placed on the case of  Member Board 
of  Revenue/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab,  Lahore  Vs. 
Abdul  Majeed  &  Another  (PLD  2015  SC  166)  wherein  it  has  been 
held that the Chief Settlement Commissioner/Notified Officer is not 
competent  to  make  any  fresh  or  alternate  allotment  of  land. 
Furthermore,  after  the  Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons 
Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975,  the  land  was  vested  in  the  Provincial 
Government  against the paid  price  and  disposal of such land has  to 
take  place  according  to  scheme  framed  by  Provincial  Government 
whereas  the  Notified  Officer has no  authority  to  allot the  land  after 
repealed  laws  as  the  land  was  not  available  for  any  allotment.

Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases  of  Syed  Saifullah  Vs.  Board  of 
Revenue,  Balochistan  through  its  Member  (RJT)  &  4  Others  (1991 
SCMR 1255) and Mirza Zafar Ali & Others Vs. Lahore Cantonment 
Cooperative  Housing  Society  Limited  (2005  SCMR  985)  whereas 
the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  (Lands),  Punjab,  Lahore  on 
30.05.1992  and  24.06.1993  passed  orders  of  allotment  of  land 
measuring  25-Kanals  06-Marlas  in  Harbanspura  Cantt.,  Lahore  qua 
the  unsatisfied  258  PIUs  urban  in  favour  of  respondent  No.10 
(allottee)  in  contravention  of  the  Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced 
Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975  as  well  as  the  Scheme  for  the 
Management and Disposal of Available Urban Properties, 1977 and 
also  against  the  dictum  laid  down  in  Ramzan‟s  as  well  as  Ali 
Muhammad  and  Rafaqat  Ali‟s  cases.  Admittedly,  the  land  of 
Harbanspura  is  declared  building  site  which  was  not  available  for 
any  allotment  whereas  the  Notified  Officer  went  beyond  his 
jurisdiction  in  making  allotment  of  urban  evacuee  land  against  the 
unadjusted  PIU  rather  same  can  only  be  disposed  of  through 
unrestricted open  auction, as  such, the  order  passed by  the  Notified 
Officer in favour of Nawabzada Walayat Ali Khan dated 30.05.1992 
and  mutation  No.10445  dated  24.06.1993  are  illegal  and  void  ab-
initio,  as  such,  the  same  are  not  sustainable  in  the  eye  of  law 
consequently  subsequent  orders  of  the  Notified  Officer  dated 
18.06.2016  as  well  as  order  of  ADCG  dated  22.08.2016  have  no 
substratum to stand, as such, same are set aside accordingly.

The  next point  for  adjudication  and determination before  this 
Court is that;- 
 
(2)  whether  the  Member  (Residual  Properties)  has  the 
jurisdiction  to  order  the  sale  of  urban  evacuee  /  state  land  to 
the encroachers, illegal occupants  who took possession of the 
state land since 1995? 
Admittedly,  land  measuring  253-Kanals  04-Marlas  comprising 
Khasra  Nos.142  to  1431,  1435-1477  to  1485  and  1488  to  1517 
situated  in  Mauza  Harbanspura  was  an  evacuee  land  which  was 
transferred to the TDCP vide Colony Department Memo No.360-56-
1/805  dated  16.03.1986  for  the  establishment  of  tourist  village  but 
due  to  deficiency  of  the  funds  the  said  project  could  not  be 
accomplished  and  Managing  Director,  T.D.C.P.  vide  Memo 
No.TDCP/  DM(P&D)/93/117  dated  27.05.1993 
intimated 
the 
Member, Board of Revenue for surrender of 203-Kanals land which 
was in possession of illegal occupants. Rafaqat Ali and 28 others, the 
occupants in possession of the land filed application under Section 3 
of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 
1975  for  the  purchase  of  land  under  their  possession  which 
application was dismissed. They filed a Writ Petition No.103-R/1995 
which  was  allowed  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated  11.07.1995 
thereafter  the  said  Rafaqat  Ali  alienated  his  possessory  right  to 
respondents  No.1  to  8  sitting  occupants  (the  petitioners  of  Writ 
Petition No.39990/2016). Against the above order of this Court, the 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  filed  Civil  Appeal  No.969/1996 
which  was  allowed  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  vide  judgment

dated  22.04.1998  (reported  as  1998  SCMR  2596)  holding  therein 
that Rafaqat Ali etc. were not eligible to purchase the said land and 
also  directed  the  Member  /  Administrator  (Residual  Properties)  to 
dispose  of  said  evacuee  urban  land  as  per  the  Scheme  for  the 
Management and Disposal of Available Urban Properties, 1977.  
After  having  lost  the  cause  upto  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan  Rafaqat  Ali  and  others  again  filed  application  on 
07.12.2007  whereas  the  subsequent  vendees  respondents  No.1  to  8 
“the  occupants”  filed  application on 20.11.2009  for  the  purchase  of 
said land through private treaty on the prevailing market price which 
request  was  accepted  by  the  Member  (Residual  Properties)  vide 
order  dated  09.07.2010  holding  that  the  land  be  sold  to  the  sitting 
occupants  at  the  market  price  plus  50%  penalty  which  order  was 
assailed by the occupants through W.P. No.206-R/2010 and learned 
Single Judge in Chamber partially allowed the said writ petition and 
set aside the imposition of 50% penalty. Feeling dis-satisfied by the 
above order, Senior Member, Board of Revenue filed captioned Intra 
Court  Appeal  No.638/2011,  whereas  legal  heirs  of  Nawabzada 
Walayat Ali Khan respondent No.10(i) to (vi) “the allottees” of said 
land also filed writ petition No.176056/2018 challenging the order of 
Notified Officer dated 09.07.2010 with the assertion that the land has 
already  been  allotted  to  them  vide  order  dated  30.05.1992  and 
mutation  No.10444  dated  24.06.1993  whereof  has  already  been

attested in their favour, as such, said land was not available for any 
transfer through private treaty and the same is liable to be set aside. 
9. 
Admittedly, the land in question has already been declared as 
building  site  vide  notification  dated  16.05.1973  issued  under  the 
provisions  of 
the  Displaced  Persons 
(Compensation 
and 
Rehabilitation)  Act,  1958  which  notification  has  been  validated  by 
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. All the evacuee laws stood 
repeal  through  the  Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws 
(Repeal)  Act,  1975  w.e.f.  Ist  July  1974  and  under  Section  3  of  the 
Act  ibid.  all  the  evacuee  properties  both  urban  or  rural  including 
agricultural land stood transferred to the province and the Provincial 
Government  has  been  empowered  to  dispose  of  the  same  through

(ii)  any  site  on  which  any  building  existed  but  was  completely 
demolished  by  floods,  fire,  incendiary  or  by  any  natural 
calamity.” 
Similarly  according  to  claim  of  possessory  right,  possession  is  a 
determining  factor  and  only  those  occupants  would  be  considered 
eligible  to  apply  for  such  allotment  who  retain  possession  on  the 
terminus date i.e. on 01.01.1976 and word possession has also been 
defined in para 1(i) of Scheme supra as under:-

Rafaqat Ali in 1995 and constructed their houses on the said land. It 
is interesting that Rafaqat Ali earlier filed application to purchase the 
evacuee  land  measuring  80-Kanals  comprising  Khasra  Nos.1488, 
1493,  1494,  1499,  1500,  1504,  1505,  1506  and  1511  situated  in 
Harbanspura, Tehsil Cantt., District Lahore under his possession but 
his  request  was  finally  stood  rejected  through  Civil  Appeal 
No.969/1996  vide  order  dated  22.04.1998  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  which  decision  is  reported  as  Member,  Board  of 
Revenue,  Punjab,  Lahore  Vs.  Rafaqat  Ali  (1998  SCMR  2596), 
declaring  wherein  that  after  notification  dated  16.05.1973  every 
agricultural  urban  land  which  had  not  been  adjusted,  allotted,  or 
utilized  against  verified  claim  uptill 
the 
issuance  of  above 
notification shall cease to be available for any kind of adjustment or 
allotment etc. qua such claim. It is further held that the Act XIV of 
1975  became  effective  from  the  Ist  day  of  July  1974, therefore, the 
status of evacuee property as exist on such date could not be changed 
or  converted  subsequent  to  the  promulgation  of  said  enactment  and 
further held as under:- 
“4.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at some 
length,  the  material  available  on  record  and  have  also  gone 
through  the  judgment  rendered  by  this  Court  in  the  case  of 
Muhammad Ramzan (supra). It is an admitted fact that the Chief 
Settlement  and  Rehabilitation  Commissioner,  Punjab  exercising 
powers  under  clause  (b)  of  subsection  (3)  of  section  2  of  the 
Displaced  Persons  (Land  Settlement)  Act,  1958,  has  vide 
Notification  dated  16-5-1973 ,  declared  all  the  available  evacuee 
urban  land  including  such  areas  which  had  not  yet  been 
confirmed  to  any  person  against  verified  Produce  index  Units, 
located within urban limits of Municipal Corporation, Municipal 
Committee,  Town  Area  Committee,  Small  Town  Committee, 
Sanitary  Committee  or  Cantonment  throughout  the  Province  of 
Punjab  as  “building  sites”.  It  is  also  an  admitted  fact  that  when

the  evacuee  laws  were  repealed  by  the  Repeal  Ordinance,  I974 
followed by Act  XIV of l975,  the evacuee Urban land in  all the 
revenue  estates  situate  within  the  urban  limits  of  Municipal 
Corporation  in  the  Province  of  Punjab  were  declared  “building 
sites”  for  disposal  under  section  13  of  the  Displaced  Persons 
(Land Settlement) Act, 1958. Thus, visualized, upon repeal of the 
evacuee  laws,  only  pending  proceedings  or  those  cases  decided 
by  the  High  Court  or  Supreme  Court,  after  such  repeal,  which 
had been remanded to any such Authority, in the absence of such 
repeal,  were  to  be  remanded  to  the  Notified  Officer  concerned 
and required to  be disposed of in  accordance with section 2 and 
subsection (3) of section 2 of Act XIV of 1975. 
5. 
Section 3 of Act XIV of 1975 provides that all properties 
both  the  urban  and  rural  including  agricultural  land  than  other 
those  properties  attached  to  charitable,  religious  or  educational 
institutions,  whether  occupied  or  unoccupied,  which  may  be 
available  for  disposal  immediately  before  the  repeal  of  the  laws 
or which may become available for disposal after such repeal, as 
a  result  of  final  order  passed  under  subsection  (3)  of  section  2 
stood  transferred  to  the  Provincial  Government  on  payment  of 
price  and  in  case  of  urban  property,  a  Scheme  of  their  disposal 
was  to  be  prepared  by  the  Provincial  Government  and  rural 
properties were to be disposed of by the Board of Revenue under 
a  Scheme  to  be  prepared  by  the  Provincial  Government.  It  is 
further  provided  therein  that  agricultural  land  occupied  by  any 
person  continuously  for  four  harvests  immediately  preceding 
Kharif, 1973, shall first be offered for sale to such person unless 
an  order  of  ejectment  has  been  passed  against  him  in  respect  of 
the land but only that much land shall be offered to such person 
as does not together with the land already held by him, exceeds a 
subsistence  holding  within  the  meaning  of  Land  Reforms 
Regulation, 1972. The other provisions relating to allotment to a 
displaced person from Jammu and Kashmir State are not relevant 
for deciding the controversy in hand.  
Reference  may  also  made  to  (PLD  1977  Punjab  Statute 
6. 
page  62)  to ‏‏ show  that  the  Government  of  Punjab  prepared  a 
prescribed  scheme  for 
the‏  Management  and  Disposal  of 
Available Urban Properties. Reference may also be‏ made to PLD 
1985 Punjab Statutes page 6, which shows that certain provisions‏ 
of  the  scheme  were  amended  in  1984.  Chapter  4  of  the  Scheme 
relates  to‏  Disposal  of  Available  Properties.  Paragraph  6  of  the 
Scheme  deals  with  transfer‏  of  house,  shop  and  building  site 
having  construction.  The  term  “available‏  property”  is  defined 
vide paragraph 1 (C) as under:-  
“Available Properties” mean houses, shops building sites, 
hotels,  Industrial  concerns  and  cinema  house  (whether 
allotted  by  the  Industries  Rehabilitation  Board  or  not) 
which  were  available  for  disposal  on  and  immediately 
before the first day of July, 1974 or which may thereafter 
become  available  for  disposal  but  do  not 
include 
properties  attached  to  charitable,  religious  or  educational 
trusts or institutions.”

The  term  “Building  Site”  is  defined  in  paragraph  1  (d)  which 
reads thus:  
Building Site means any vacant plot of land which is not within a 
well-defined compound of a permanent building and includes: 
(1)  a  site  on  which  the  permanent  construction,  if  any,  does  not 
exceed an area by 1/8th of the site;  
(ii)  any  site  on  which  any  building  existed  but  was  completely 
demolished  by  floods,  fire,  incendiary  or  by  any  natural 
calamity.” 
the  case  of  Muhammad  Ramzan  (supra) 
In 
this  Court 
exhaustively  discussed  the  scope  of  the  Notification  dated  16-5-
1973   and  declared  that  on  the  promulgation   of  the  Notification, 
dated 16th, May 1973, no agricultural urban land existed or was 
available for Disposal and that when the Act XIV, 1975 became 
operative  there  was  no  land  available  for  adjustment  against 
Produce  Index  Units.  Mere  fact  that  some  matters  regarding 
adjustment of specified land, were under consideration or had not 
been  carried  out,  would  not  bring  the  grievance  within  the 
purview of section 2(2) of Act XIV of 1975.  Therefore, Notified 
Officer  had  no  jurisdiction  to  allot,  or  transfer  the  land  or  grant 
alternate  lands  again  unadjusted  verified  units.  In  the  case  of 
Muhammad  Ramzan  (supra)  the  dicta  laid  down  in  the  cases  of 
Bashir Ahmed v. Punjab University Academic Staff Association 
(1991  SCMR  377),  Syed  Saifullah  v.  Board  of  Revenue, 
Balochistan  through  Member  (RJT)  (1991  SCMR  1255)  and 
Member  Board  of  Revenue,  Punjab 
and 
Rehabilitation  Wing)  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab, 
Lahore  v.  Muhammad  Mustafa  (1993  SCMR  732),  were 
reiterated that the Chief Settlement Commissioner was competent 
to issue notification for converting agricultural land into building 
sites  and  consequently,  Notification  dated  16-5-1973  was  valid, 
therefore,  on  the  issuance  of  said  Notification  every  agricultural 
land  which  had  not  been  adjusted,  allotted,  or  utilized  till  then 
against verified claim ceases to be available for such claim.  It is 
further held that the Act XIV of 1975 became effective from the 
first  day  of  July,  1974,  therefore,  the  status  of  evacuee  property 
as  existed  on  such  date  could  not  be  changed  or  converted 
subsequent to promulgation of said enactment. It was further held 
that the Notification dated 16-5-1973 was executory in nature and 
became  operative  immediately  on  its  issuance  and  this  had  the 
effect of converting unutilized agricultural urban in entire Punjab 
to be building site.  
(Settlement 
7. 
As to the contention that the property in dispute was rural 
agricultural land, suffice it to say that, there is nothing on record 
to  show  that  the  property  in  dispute  located  in  Harbanspura, 
Lahore,  was  not  a  part  of  urban  agricultural  land  to  answer 
description  of  “available  property”.  In  any  event,  this  disputed 
question  of  fact  cannot  be  raised  for  the  first  time  in  these 
proceedings. Clearly, with the repeal of evacuee laws in 1975, the 
unallotted agricultural land vested in  the Provincial Government 
against  price  paid  for  it,  therefore,  its  disposal  had  to  take  place 
according  to  the  relevant  Scheme  framed  by  the  Provincial

Government  in  the  year,  1977,  as  amended  in  1985.   We  are 
fortified in taking this view which is in accord with the dicta laid 
down in the case of Syed Saifullah (supra).”  
Further the respondents occupants themselves asserted in para Nos.3 
and  4  of  their  application  moved  before  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner in CSC Case No.887 of 2009 that:- 
“3. 
That  the  land  being  evacuee  was  allotted  against  urban 
claim  in  the  year  1989  in  the  name  of  Mukaram  Ali  Khan,  the 
grandson of Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister 
of Pakistan. Rafaqat Ali, being in possession of the land agitated 
against  the  allotment  and  got  the  mutation  in  the  name  of  the 
allottee cancelled. Thereafter, Rafaqat Ali applied for purchase of 
the  land  under  section  3  of  the  Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced 
Persons  Laws(Repeal)  Act  XIV  of  1975.  The  sale  was  refused, 
whereupon  he  filed  writ  petition  No.103-R/1995  in  the  Lahore 
High  Court,  Lahore.  The  writ  petition  was  allowed  ,  vide  order, 
dated  11.07.1995  by  a  learned  Single  Judge  of  Lahore  High 
Court.  After  the  judgment  in  his  favour  Rafaqat  Ali  passed  on 
possession  of  the  land  to  the  applicants  and  others  who  are  in 
possession of houses constructed by them. 
Application  for  issue  of  certified  copies  of  order  of  the  High 
Court  and  the  writ  petition  has  been  submitted.  Certified  copies 
will  be  filed  in  this  Court  as  and  when  received  by  the 
respondent/applicant. 
4. 
That  the  Chief  Settlement  aggrieved  of  the  order  of  the 
High Court dated 11.07.1995 filed Civil Appeal No.969 of 1996 
which  was  allowed  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  vide 
judgment, dated 22.04.1998. The order of the High Court was set 
aside and it was held that the land being building site is available 
for disposal under the provisions of the Scheme For The Disposal 
of Available Urban Properties, 1977. The judgment is reported as 
1998 SCMR 2596.” 
Admittedly, 
the 
respondents 
(occupants)  are  purchasers  of 
possession from said Rafaqat Ali whose claim over the very suit land 
has already been rejected by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
declaring  said  Rafaqat  Ali  disentitled to purchase the  suit  land  then 
subsequent  vendees  from  him  cannot  be  considered  eligible  to 
purchase  the  evacuee  land  measuring  64-Kanals  03-Marlas  rather 
their  claim  if  any  has  to  sail  and  sink  with  their  vendor‟s  right  as

W.P. No.39990/2016 
W.P. No.176056/2018 
 
 
25 
they  have  no  independent  status.  Moreover,  the  learned  Single 
Judge-in-Chamber  has  conclusively  held  that  the  above  illegal 
occupants  drive  no  right  in  any  respect  from  the  said  Rafaqat  Ali 
which in entirety dis-associate them for the right of their predecessor 
and said findings have not been challenged any further which lead to 
conveniently observe that respondents occupants are even precluded 
to claim the right of possession from their vendor‟s possessory right 
since 01.01.1976 whereas they took the possession of the respective 
land  in  1995  much  subsequent  to  terminus  date  of  possession  i.e. 
01.01.1976, as such, they are not entitled to purchase the land as laid 
down  in  the  supra  judgment  passed  in  Rafaqat  Ali  case,  therefore, 
the  order  of  the  Member  (Residual  Properties),  Board  of  Revenue 
dated  09.07.2010  for  sale  of  property  at  market  price  plus  50% 
penalty  as  well  as  the  order  passed  by  this  Court  in  a  Writ  Petition 
No.206-R/2010  dated  30.09.2011  maintaining  the  sale  of  evacuee 
urban  land  at  market  price  are  contrary  to  the  dictum  laid  down  by 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan whereas under Article 189 of the 
Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  the  orders  of 
Hon‟ble Apex Court are binding upon all the organs of the state. It is 
settled law that when law does not permit to achieve a thing directly, 
the same could not be allowed to be obtained indirectly. Reliance can 
be placed on Bank of Punjab and another Vs. Haris Steel Industries 
(Pvt.)  Ltd.  and  others  (PLD  2010  SC  1109).  The  Hon‟ble  Apex 
Court in the said judgment held as under:-  
 
I.C.A. No.638/2011 
W.P. No.39990/2016 
W.P. No.176056/2018

“If the interpretation  canvassed by Mr.  Irfan  Qadir, ASC was to 
be accepted then the same would not only defeat the clear object 
of  the  provision  in  question  but  would  also  lead  to  a  blatant 
absurdity.  It would be preposterous and irrational to declare that 
once  an  incumbent  of  the  office  of  the  Prosecutor  General  had 
completed  his  term  of  three  years  then  no  one  had  the 
competence  to  extend  or  enlarge  the  said  term  even  by  one  day 
but  the  same  competent  authority  could  instead,  grant  him  three 
years by appointing him afresh to the same office. In the recorded 
judicial  history  such  a  situation  attracted  judicial  notice  in  the 
year  1889  in  case  of  Madden  V.  Nelson  (1889  AC  626)  and  it 
was Lord Helsbury who declared for the first time that what was 
not permitted by law to be achieved directly could not be allowed 
to  be  achieved  indirectly.  And  the  said  principle  has  been 
repeatedly  acknowledged  and  followed  by  the  Courts  ever  since 
then  and  the  Courts  in  Pakistan  are  no  exception  in  the  said 
connection.  The  cases  of  Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz  Sharif  and 
Haji Muhammad Boota (Supra ) are evidence to the said effect.” 
Reliance can also be placed on a judgment of this Court reported as 
Muhammad  Sajjad  Husain  Vs.  Government  of  Punjab  through 
Secretary Establishment, Lahore and 19 others (2013 PLC (C.S) 1). 
Moreover,  regarding  the  similar  character  of  land  in  Mauza 
Harbanspura Lahore, Punjab the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in  American  International  School  System  Vs.  Mian  Muhammad  Ramzan 
and  others  (2015  SCMR  1449),  after  discussing  in  detail  the 
provisions  of  the  policy  has  conclusively  held  that  the  subject 
evacuee  land  could  only  be  disposed  of  through  unrestricted  open 
auction in terms of paras 6 (3), 11, 12 and 30 of the Scheme 1977. 
11.  Furthermore,  from  the  perusal  of  Section  3(1)(a)  of  the 
Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975 
and  the  definitions  of  building  site  as  well  as  the  determination  of 
any possessory rights and parameters for the disposal of the available 
properties  are  elaborately  mentioned  in  para  Nos.1(d)  and  1(i)  read 
with paras 6, 11, 12 and 30 of the Scheme for the Management and

Disposal  of  Urban  Properties,  1977.  Keeping  in  view  the  binding 
effect  of  notification  dated  16.05.1973  whereby  all  the  evacuee 
properties  have  already  been  declared  building  site  and  under  para 
1(i)  of  policy  scheme  1977  only  those  occupants  who  have 
possession  on  or  before  01.01.1976  are  only  considered  eligible  to 
purchase the evacuee land or apply for the grant of proprietary rights 
whereas  the  respondents  occupants  themselves  admitted  in  their 
petition  of  having  possession  in  the  year  1995  much  after  the 
determined  terminus  date  which  dismantle  their  claim.  Moreover, 
respondents No.1 to 8 the occupants neither mentioned in their writ 
petition  nor  before  this  Court  that  they  were  in  possession  of  land 
before the 1st day of January 1976. Admittedly, they got possession 
in 1995 from said Rafaqat Ali whose rights after proper adjudication 
has been extinguished infinitum, as such, the subsequent vendees in 
possession have no independent right or entitlement to purchase the 
land  under  para  No.6  of  the  Scheme  rather  conjunctive  reading  of 
para 6(3), 11  and 30  of  Scheme  1977 furnishes accumulative affect 
to  dispose  of  the  evacuee  properties  through  unrestricted  open 
auction  as  settled  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 
American  International  School  System  case  (supra),  as  such, the  order 
dated  09.07.2010  passed  by  the  Member  (Residual  Properties), 
Board  of  Revenue  for  the  sale  of  evacuee  land  to  subsequent 
occupants is against the policy as well as against parameters settled 
by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  reported  as

Member,  Board  of  Revenue,  Punjab,  Lahore  Vs.  Rafaqat  Ali  (1998 
SCMR 2596). Furthermore, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in  a  C.P.  No.709-L/2009  titled  as  “Member  (Judicial-V),  Board  of 
Revenue/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab  &  2  Others  Vs. 
Sagheer Muhammad Khan & Others” settled that after repeal of Act 
all  such  property  shall  have  to  be  disposed  of  through  unrestricted 
open  auction  so  that  assets  vested  in  Province  which  ultimately 
belongs  to  the  people  of  the  province  shall  be  duly  protected  and 
safeguarded. The relevant portion whereof is reproduced as under:- 
Considering  the  above,  we  are  clear  firstly  that  the 
“7. 
conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Bench in para 9 of the 
impugned  judgment,  as  reproduced  above  is  incorrect  and  the 
reliance  on  the  case  of  Muhammad  Hussain  (supra)  is  also 
misplaced. Secondly, it is evident that as of date, the respondents 
can have no claim on the property in question.  According to the 
current  law  and  arrangements  put  in  place  by  the  Province 
subsequent  to  the  Repeal  Act  the  property  will  have  to  be 
disposed of through open public auction so that the assets vested 
in  the  Province  and  ultimately  in  the  people  of  the  Province  are 
duly  protected.  This  shall  not  prevent  the  Province  from 
proceeding against the respondents or others both for recovery of 
compensation for occupation and use of the property and for any 
other  action  civil  or  criminal  in  this  case.  This  petition  is 
converted  into  appeal  and  is  allowed  in  the  above  terms.” 
(Underline to place emphasis) 
Whereas  the  above  legal  and  factual  aspect  perhaps  have  not  been 
debated before the learned Single Judge in Chamber and significant 
facts  escaped  from  his  judicial  consideration  as  such  the  impugned 
order  dated  30.09.2011  passed  in  writ  petition  maintaining  the  sale 
of the land at market price as well as order dated 09.07.2010 of Chief 
Settlement Commissioner are not inconsonance with law and policy 
as  Notified  Officer  was  not  competent  to  allot  land  to  illegal 
occupants, encroachers who were not in possession of evacuee  land

on  01.01.1976  rather  he  also  adopted  modus  operandi  which  is  not 
warranted  by  any  law  policy  or  any  instruction  which  is  farcical 
order  in  nature  and  can  be  termed  as  void  ab-initio  and  not 
sustainable in the eyes of law which shall be considered to have been 
set aside.  
12. 
In  view  of  the  above  the  impugned  order  passed  by  learned 
Single  Judge-in-Chamber  dated  30.09.2011  as  well  as  order  of  the 
Notified  Officer  dated  09.07.2010  are  not  sustainable  which  are 
hereby set aside. Resultantly, the application for the purchase of the 
land  is  considered  to  have  been  rejected  accordingly.  Member  / 
Administrator  (Residual  Properties)  is  directed  to  expeditiously 
retrieve the possession from the illegal occupants as per law.   
13.  As discussed above, the captioned  Intra Court Appeal as well 
as both the writ petitions are disposed of accordingly.
