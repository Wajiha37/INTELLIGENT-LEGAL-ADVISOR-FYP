AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through 
this 
second 
appeal  the  appellants  have  challenged  the  judgment  &  decree 
dated  19.04.2011  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 
Judge,  Jhang  whereby  the  appeal  filed  by  the  appellants  was 
dismissed  and  the  judgment  &  decree  dated  05.06.1995  passed 
by  the  learned  Civil Judge  1st  Class, Jhang  whereby  the suit  for 
declaration filed by the plaintiffs/respondents was decreed.  
2. 
 
 The brief facts are that the plaintiffs/respondents on 
27.02.1992 filed a suit for declaration to challenge the attestation 
of mutation No.695 attested on 24.07.1990 of inheritance of Gull 
Muhammad  s/o  Walia  pleading  that  the  same  has  been  attested 
presuming the deceased professing Sheia Faith and therefore 1/8 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
2 
share  of  property  was  given  to  his  widow  and  7/8  share  to  his 
two  daughters  as  he  was  having  no  male  issue.  The  plaintiffs 
being collaterals of deceased claimed that he was Sunny by Faith 
and mutation is wrong.   
3. 
 
The  written  statement  was  filed  and  suit  was 
contested.  Learned 
trial  court  on  18.04.1992  framed 
the 
following issues:- 
1.  Whether  the  suit  is  collusive  with  the  defendant 
No.4? OPD  
 
2.  Whether  the  plaintiffs  have  no  cause  of  action  and 
locus-standi to file this suit? OPD  
 
3.  Whether the plaintiffs are estopped by their own act 
and conduct to file this suit? OPD  
 
4.  Whether the defendants are entitled to special costs 
u/s 35-A of CPC? OPD  
 
5.  Whether this court lacks jurisdiction to try this suit? 
OPD  
 
6.  Whether this suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary 
parties to the suit? OPD  
 
7.  Whether  this  suit  is  not  properly  valued  for  the 
purposes of court fee? OPD  
 
8.  Whether  the  late  Gul  Muhammad  s/o  Wallia  was 
Sunni  Muslim  by  faith, if  so,  whether  the  mutation 
No.695 dated 24.7.90 is void, ineffective and liable 
to cancellation? OPP

Learned trial court invited the parties to produce their evidence. 
Both the parties produced oral as well as documentary evidence 
in  support  of  their  versions.  After  the  completion  of  trial  vide 
judgment  &  decree  dated  05.06.1995  suit  was  decreed  by  the 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
3 
learned  trial  court.  In  the  first  round  of  litigation  the  appeal 
preferred by the present appellants was dismissed on 14.03.1998, 
where  against  R.S.A.No.19  of  1998  was  filed,  which  was 
accepted by this Court  on 03.02.2011 and  matter was remanded 
to the learned first appellate court with a direction to decide the 
application filed under Order XLI Rule 27 of the CPC within one 
month  and  thereafter  decide  the  appeal.  Learned  first  appellate 
court  accepted  the  application  for  permission  to  produce 
additional  evidence  filed  by  the  appellants/defendants  but 
dismissed the appeal vide judgment & decree dated 19.04.2011. 
Hence, this second appeal before this Court.  
4. 
 
Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants/defendants  has 
read  the  complete  oral  evidence  led  by  the  parties  and  has 
formulated 
his 
points 
that 
the 
oral 
evidence 
of 
plaintiffs/respondents  is  contrary  one.  Further  that  the  oral 
evidence  against  the  documentary  evidence  cannot  be  given 
more  weight.  Further  that  the  statements  of  witnesses  of 
plaintiffs to the extent of partial denial of Exh.P-1 is not tenable 
under  the  law.  The  Chowkidar  who  got  the  death  entry  of  Gull 
Muhammad  deceased  entered  was  not  produced.  The  plaintiffs 
have not proved the pedigree table in accordance with Article 64 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.  
5. 
 
On 
the  other  hand, 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs argues that there are concurrent findings of 
fact recorded by two courts below and the appellants/defendants 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
4 
failed to make out a case in the light of Section 100 of the CPC. 
Argues  that  the  deceased  passed  away  on  08.11.1987,  Exh.P-3 
his death entry was got entered by Khalil Ahmad Chowkidar on 
30.11.1987.  The  mutation  was  entered  by  the  Patwari  on 
01.05.1990 and it was attested on 24.07.1990. The suit was filed 
within the period of limitation i.e. on 27.02.1992. States that all 
the  witnesses  produced  by  the  plaintiffs/respondents  are  of  the 
same locality which confirms that all the residents of area profess 
Sunni  Faith,  whereas  none  of  the  witnesses  produced  by  the 
defendants  is  resident  of  village,  even  none  of  the  contesting 
defendants  appeared  in  the  witness  box.  They  preferred  to 
produce  their  attorney  who  too  is  the  resident  of  other  village. 
States  that  the  fact,  all  the  family  of  deceased  was  professing 
Sunni  Faith  as  the  plaintiffs  are  collaterals,  the  contesting 
defendants were bound to plead and prove that Gull Muhammad 
converted his Faith, they were bound under the law to plead and 
prove  this  fact  with  full  detail  but  same  is  missing. Further  that 
when all the legal heirs in accordance with Sunni sect have been 
mentioned in the pedigree table prepared on the pert of mutation, 
which  shows  that  at  the  time  of  entry  of  mutation  there  was  no 
question  of  deceased  being  Sheia,  subsequently  with  the 
connivance of contesting defendants the issue of Sheia Faith was 
introduced  and  mutation  was  wrongly  attested.  Further  argues 
that all the witnesses whose signatures are upon the mutation as 
Lumberdar  and  Pattidar  have  stated  that  they  attested  the  only 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
5 
pedigree table and they never stated that deceased was professing 
Sheia Faith. Prays for dismissal of the instant appeal.  
6. 
 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at 
full length and also gone through the record minutely with their 
able  assistance  as  well  as  the  concurrent  findings  recorded  by 
two courts below.  
7. 
 
In  accordance  with  the  prevailing  law  upon  the 
subject declared by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan which 
start  from  the  judgment  reported  as  “PATHANA  versus  Mst. 
WASAI  AND  ANOTHER”  (PLD  1965  Supreme  Court  134) 
whereby  it  has  been  declared  that:  “In  the  Indo-Pak  Sub-
continent  there  is  the  initial  presumption  that  a  Muslim  is 
governed by Hanafi Law, unless the contrary is established by 
good evidence (vide Mulla’s Muhammadan Law, Section 28)”. 
I have noticed that one of the plaintiffs as well as the witnesses 
produced by  the  plaintiffs stated that not only  the  deceased  was 
professing  Sunni  Faith  but  also  the  family  of  deceased  profess 
Sunni Faith, therefore, the question of conversion of faith by the 
deceased  arise  as  argued  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
respondents/plaintiffs that neither the defendants/appellants have 
claimed conversion of deceased from Sunni sect to Sheia sect nor 
there is any evidence to this effect. In these circumstances, I am 
unable to disagree with the concurrent findings recorded by two 
courts  below  holding  that  the  deceased  was  professing  Sunni 
sect. Reliance can be placed upon  “MUHAMMAD BASHIR and 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
6 
others versus Mst. LATIFA BIBI through LRs” (2010 S C M R 
1915), “HAJI KHUDA BAKHSH versus MUHAMMAD SALEEM 
AKBAR  SHAH  and  others”  (1999  CLC  1608)  and  “ALLAH 
BAKHSH and others versus Mst. BHAGAN” (1994 CLC 1942).  
8. 
 
So far as the objection raised by the learned counsel 
for  the  appellants  that  Exh.P-3  was  not  proved  by  producing 
Khalil  Ahmad  Chowkidar  who  got  the  entries  entered.  I  have 
noticed  that  Exh.P-3  is  certified  copy  from  the  Register  of 
deaths,  which  shows  the  death  entry  of  Gull  Muhammad 
deceased son of Kalia Sunni Muslim resident of Chak No.256/J 
Union Council No.22 Chak No.250 Tehsil & District Jhang. No 
objection was raised at the time of admission of this document in 
evidence  nor  against 
this  entry 
in  death 
register 
the 
defendants/appellants claimed any other entry or proved Exh.P-3 
to  be  a  wrong  document.  Therefore,  the  objection  raised  by  the 
learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  qua  non-admissibility  of  this 
document is not tenable. The witnesses of contesting defendants 
are residents of other area. None of them is the resident of Chak 
No.256/J.B  where  the  deceased  was  residing.  The  case  pleaded 
as  well  as  evidence  produced  by  the  plaintiffs  that  Lumberdar 
and  the  witnesses  stated  that  they  have  attested  pedigree  table 
prepared by the Patwari as noted supra that mutation was entered 
on 01.05.1990 and was attested after a period of near about 1 ¾ 
months  of  entry  of  mutation  and  the  argument  advanced  by  the 
learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs is near to logic that 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
7 
if  the  deceased  was  professing  Sheia  Faith  and  his  legal  heirs 
were  widow  and  two  daughters,  then  there  was  no  need  to 
prepare  the  complete  pedigree  table  showing  the  collaterals  of 
the  deceased.  When  the  complete  pedigree  table  was  prepared, 
meaning thereby that at the time of entry  of  mutation there was 
no dispute about the sect of deceased as Sunni Muslim. This fact 
is  further  supported  by  the  entering  note  of  Patwari  which  does 
not  show  that  the  deceased  was  a  Sheia  Muslim.  More  so,  the 
defendants have not claimed any other person in the Chak to be 
professing  Sheia  Faith  as  no  witness  from  the  Chak  was 
produced. When the contesting defendants opted not to appear as 
their  own  witnesses  and  produced  their  attorney  without  any 
justifiable reasons, then a presumption can be taken against them 
in the light of  Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act, 1872/Article 
129  Illustration  (g)  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984.    In  this 
regard,  reliance  can  be  placed  upon  the  judgments  reported  as 
“FAZAL DAD and others versus JEHANDAD and others” (1991 
CLC  1783),  “Mst.  SURAYIA  BEGUM  and  another  versus 
SARDR  SAEED  ULLAH  through  L.Rs.”  (2006  CLC  994)  and 
“Mst. SARWAR NOOR versus Ali HAIDER and another” (2009 
CLC 400).  
9. 
 
In  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  defendants 
were  required  to  prove  the  conversion  of  deceased  Gull 
Muhammad from Sunni Faith to Sheia Faith in the light of “Mst. 
DAULAN  versus  MUHAMMAD  HAYAT”  (2002  YLR  3247). 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
8 
Even  in  case  in  hand  the  plaintiffs  fully  proved,  rather  it  is 
admitted position that Hafiz Muhammad Jamal PW-1 who was a 
Sunni  Imam  had  led  the  funeral  prayer  of  deceased  Gull 
Muhammad.  
10.  
 
Against  the  concurrent  findings  recorded  by  two 
forums  below  on  the  basis  of  evidence  available  on  the  file  as 
well  as  law,  second  appeal  is  not  maintainable.  In  this  context, 
light  can  be  taken  from  the  judgments  reported  as  “NASEER 
AHMED SIDDIQUE through Legal Heirs versus AFTAB ALAM 
and  another”  (PLD  2011  Supreme  Court  323),  “BASHIR 
AHMED  versus  Mst.  TAJA  BEGUM  and  others”  (PLD  2010 
Supreme  Court  906)  and  “AMJAD  SHARIF  QAZI  and  others 
versus  SALIM  ULLAH  FARIDI  and  others”  (PLD  2006 
Supreme Court 777).  
11. 
 
Even  the  receipt  was  not  got  admitted  for  payment 
of  contribution  to  Sheia  Anjuman.  Therefore,  in  the  light  of 
judgment  of  august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  reported  as 
“GHULAM  SHABBIR  and  others  versus  Mst.  BAKHAT 
KHATOON  and  others”  (2009  S  C  M  R  644)  until  and  unless 
counterfoils  of  receipts  are  produced,  simple  receipts  cannot  be 
taken into consideration.  
12. 
 
In view of above discussion, learned counsel for the 
appellants has not been able to point out any illegality or material 
irregularity  in  the  concurrent  findings  recorded  by  two  courts 
below as well as misreading or non-reading of evidence available 
R.S.A.No.118 of 2011.  
9 
on  the  file.  Therefore,  no  case  for  interference  by  this  Court 
while  exercising  jurisdiction  u/s  100  of  the  CPC  is  made  out. 
Consequently, the instant regular second appeal having no force 
stands dismissed with costs throughout.
