AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through this civil revision 
the  petitioners  have  challenged  the  judgment  &  decree  dated 
07.02.2008  passed  by  the  learned  District  Judge,  Khushab 
whereby the appeal filed by the petitioners was dismissed and the 
judgment & decree dated 16.05.2002 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge,  Khushab  whereby  the  suit  filed  by  the  respondents-
plaintiffs was partially decreed.  
2. 
 
 The brief facts are that the plaintiffs/respondents on 
14.10.1996  filed  a  suit  for  declaration  pleading  therein  that  the 
plaintiff and defendants No.20 to 27 being legal heirs of Ghulam 
Muhammad  and  Hafeeza  sons  of  Phatto  are  owner  of  property 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.  
2 
measuring  115-kanals  5-marlas  out  of  total  measuring  386-
kanals  8-marlas  according  to  Register  Haqdaran  Zamin  for  the 
year  1993-94  situated  in  Mouza  Utra  Janobi  Tehsil  &  District 
Khushab. It  is stated that defendants No.1  to 19  have absolutely 
no  concern  with  the  suit  property  and  challenged  attestation  of 
mutation  No.1183  attested  on  15.06.1923  by  Mst.  Saban  in 
favour of Muhammad Yar, predecessor of defendants No.1 to 19 
on the ground that Mst. Saban was limited owner. The prayer for 
permanent  injunction  was  also  made.  It  is  further  pleaded  that 
originally  Phatto  s/o  Pallu  was  owner  of  13  ½  Aaney  in  Zar-
Khewat which comes to 230-kanals 10-marlas, who passed away 
approximately before 1914.  The suit property was transferred  in 
the  name  of  his  sons  Ghulam  Muhammad  and  Hafeeza  through 
mutation  of  inheritance.  Both  Ghulam  Muhammad  and  Hafeeza 
sons of Phatto passed away in the year 1918 being issueless. The 
share  of  Hafeeza  s/o  Phatto  was  transferred  in  favour  of  his 
widow  Mst.  Khani  as  limited  owner  through  mutation  No.508, 
whereas  share  of  Ghulam  Muhammad  was  transferred  in  favour 
of  his  mother  as  limited  owner  through  mutation  No.507.  It  is 
pleaded that thereafter Mst. Khani widow of Hafeeza contracted 
second  marriage.  The  property  from  her  name  as  limited  owner 
was  withdrawn  and  was  transferred  in  the  name  of  Mst.  Saban, 
mother  of  Hafeeza  through  mutation  No.1041.  It  is  pleaded  that 
Mst.  Saban  through  mutation  No.1183  attested  on  15.06.1923 
without any authority sold the property in favour of Muhammad 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.

Yar s/o Pallu predecessor of defendants No.1 to 19. It is pleaded 
that  in  the  year  1924-25  and  thereafter  in  the  year  1967-68 
distribution  of  Shamlaat  proceedings  were  initiated  and  the 
ownership  was 
recorded, 
therefore, 
in  accordance  with 
Jamabandi  for  the  year  1993-94  identification  of  property  has 
been  mentioned.  It  is  pleaded  that  at  the  end  of  extinction  of 
limited  ownership,  Muhammad  Yar  s/o  Pallu  being  brother  of 
last  male owner  i.e. Phatto, was entitled  to retain ½ share  in the 
suit  property.  Whereas  Noora  the  predecessor  of  plaintiffs  and 
defendants No.20 to 27, the other brother of last male owner, was 
entitled to get other half of property, therefore, the instant suit to 
challenge  mutation  No.1183  and  claiming  115-kanals  5-marlas. 
The subsequent mutations in favour of legal heirs of Muhammad 
Yar  have  also  been  challenged  and  it  is  further  pleaded  that 
attestation  of  mutation  of  inheritance  of  Mst.  Saban  bearing 
No.4168  attested  on  23.09.1938  is  a  documentary  evidence  to 
show that plaintiffs are the legal heirs.  
3. 
 
The  written  statement  was  filed  and  suit  was 
contested.  Learned  trial  court  framed  the  issues  and  invited  the 
parties  to  produce  their  respective  evidence.  Both  the  parties 
produced  oral  as  well  as  documentary  evidence.  After  the 
completion of trial suit was partially decreed by the learned trial 
court  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated  16.05.2002.  An  appeal  was 
preferred  before  the  learned  first  appellate  court,  which  was 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.  
4 
dismissed vide judgment & decree dated 07.02.2008. Hence, this 
civil revision.  
4. 
 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  states  that  he 
will  press  only  the  point  of  limitation  and  issue  regarding 
limitation for filing the suit. Admittedly Mst. Saban passed away 
in  the  year  1938  and  if  the  case  of  plaintiffs  as  pleaded  is 
admitted  to  be  true,  the  cause  of  action  accrued  firstly  on 
15.06.1923  to  the  plaintiffs  or  their  predecessor  at  the  time  of 
sale  of  property  to  the  predecessor  of  petitioners/defendants 
through  mutation  No.1183  attested  on  15.06.1923  and  lastly  in 
the year 1938 when Mst. Saban passed away and mutation of her 
inheritance No.4168 was attested on 23.09.1938, whereas the suit 
was filed in the year 1996 at least 58 years after the death of Mst. 
Saban and 73 years after the accrual of first cause of action. The 
limitation provided for suit for declaration is six years according 
to the residuary Article 120 of Limitation Act, 1908. Despite the 
fact that issue No.4 of limitation was framed but both the learned 
courts  below  failed  to  record  the  findings  on  this  issue  in 
accordance  with  law.  Prays  for  acceptance  of  instant  civil 
revision. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also relied upon 
the judgments reported as “ATTA MUHAMMAD versus MAULA 
BAKHSH  and  others”  (2007  S  C  M  R  1446),  “Mst.  GRANA 
through  Legal  Heirs  and  others  versus  SAHIB  KAMALA  BIBI 
and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 167), “NOOR DIN and 
another versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE and 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.  
5 
others”  (2014  S  C  M  R  513)  and  “MUHAMMAD  AMIR  and 
others versus Mst. BEEVI and others” (2007 S C M R 614). 
5. 
 
On 
the  other  hand, 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
respondents  states  that  there  are  concurrent  findings  of  fact 
recorded  by  two  courts  below.  States  that  in  the  matter  of 
inheritance  limitation  does  not  apply  and  it  was  not  a  hurdle  in 
filing  the  suit  and  both  the  courts  below  came  to  a  right 
conclusion  while  the  suit  filed  by  the  respondents/plaintiffs  was 
decreed and appeal there against was dismissed.  
6. 
 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at 
full  length  and  also  gone  through  the  record,  case  law  referred 
supra and the findings recorded by the learned courts below.  
7. 
 
At  this  stage  even  the  shares  pleaded  by  the 
respondents/plaintiffs  is  not  correct.  If  the  case  of  plaintiffs  is 
admitted to be true, Mst. Saban being widow of last male owner 
was also entitled to get share from inheritance. Therefore, stating 
that Muhammad Yar was entitled to ½ share and the predecessor 
of  plaintiffs,  the  other  brother  Noora,  was  entitled  ½  share  is 
wrong. 
8. 
 
The  impression  that  limitation  never  runs  in  the 
matter  of  inheritance  is  not  correct  appreciation  of  law.  I  am 
fortified by the celebrated judgment of august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan  reported  as  “ATTA  MUHAMMAD  versus  MAULA 
BAKHSH and others” (2007 S C M R 1446).  
C.R.No.141 of 2008.

9. 
 
As  the  property  was  sold  by  the  limited  owner,  in 
this  way,  it  is  not  a  case  of  possession  of  co-sharer  through 
inheritance upon the suit property, as per version of the plaintiffs, 
Mst.  Saban  was  not  entitled  to  transfer  the  ownership  rights  in 
the  suit  property  but  through  mutation  No.1183  attested  on 
15.06.1923  the  property  was  sold  in  favour  of  Muhammad  Yar 
the predecessor of defendants and subsequently when Mst. Saban 
passed  away  in  the  year  1938  mutation  of  her  inheritance 
No.4168  was  also  attested.  The  respondents/plaintiffs  or  their 
predecessor remained silent at the time of attestation of mutation 
of  sale  in  favour  of  predecessor  of  defendants/petitioners  and 
thereafter  as  per  their  own  pleadings  the  plaintiffs  or  their 
predecessor  remained  silent  in  the  year  1938  when  finally  the 
cause  of  action  accrued  to  them  and  filing  the  suit  58  years 
thereafter was certainly barred by time and limitation even in the 
matter of  inheritance cannot be ignored.  In this context, reliance 
can be placed upon the judgments reported as “Muhammad Islam 
versus Inspector General of Police, Islamabad and others” (2011 
S C M R 8), “Farman Ali versus Muhammad Ishaq and others” 
(PLD 2013 Supreme Court 392), “Mst. GRANA through Legal 
Heirs  and  others  versus  SAHIB  KAMALA  BIBI  and  others” 
(PLD  2014  Supreme  Court  167),  “Agha  Syed  MUSHTAQUE 
ALI SHAH versus Mst. BIBI GUL JAN and others” (2016 S C M 
R  910),  “NOOR  DIN  and  another  versus  ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE and others” (2014 S C M R 513), 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.

“COMMISSIONER OF  INCOME TAX, COMPANIES ZONE-IV, 
KARACHI versus HAKIM ALI ZARDARI” (2006 S C M R 170) 
and  “Hakim  MUHAMMAD  BUTA  AND  ANOTHER  versus 
HABIB AHMAD and others” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 153).” 
10. 
 
As  per  the  case  of  petitioners  that  Mst.  Saban  was 
limited  owner  and  admittedly  she  died  in  the  year  1938  and  her 
limited  interest  in  the  suit  property  terminated,  therefore,  at  that 
time under the custom if predecessor of plaintiffs was entitled to 
inherit,  he  was  required  to  challenge  the  sale  mutation  No.1183 
within  limitation  from  the  attestation  of  mutation  or  at  least  in 
the  year  1938,  which  has  not  been  done.  Even  with  the 
promulgation  of  West  Pakistan  Muslim  Personal  Law  (Shariat) 
Application Act (V of 1962), in accordance with Section 3 of the 
Act  at  the  most  termination  of  limited  estate  the  limitation  for 
filing  a  suit  available  with  the  plaintiffs  under  residuary  Article 
120  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908  was  six  years,  whereas  the  suit 
has  been  filed  on  14.10.1996.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  the 
judgment of august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “Mst. 
JANNAT BIBI versus SHER MUHAMMAD and others” (1988 S 
C  M  R  1696).”  I  would  like  to  quote  relevant  paragraph  as 
follows:- 
“This  brings  up  the  particular  aspect  of  this  case  which 
seems  to  have  been  overlooked  by  the  High  Court.  The 
plaintiff’s  suit  was  based  upon  right  created  by  the 
statutory provisions, namely, section 3 of the Act of 1962, 
whereby  limited  estates  of  Muslim  females  under  the 
Customary  law  were  terminated  and  under  section  5  such 
females were entitled to their Muslim law share as heirs of 
C.R.No.141 of 2008.  
8 
the  last  full  owner.  It  is,  therefore,  clear  that  new  rights 
were created by operation of law in favour of the appellant 
in  respect of the estate of  the deceased. Since these rights 
were  not  being  enjoyed  by  the  appellant  prior  to  1962, 
there  can  be  no  question  of  her  having  brought  a  suit  for 
possession on that basis on a date prior to the enforcement 
of  the  said  Act  of  1962.  Looking  at  the  matter  in  this 
perspective, 
to 
possession  as  full  owner  as  a  Muslim  heir  vesting  in  the 
appellant having accrued in 1962, the suit filed in 1966 for 
possession was still within time.” 
it  becomes  manifest 
the  right 
that 
 
 
In  the  light  of  what  has  been  discussed  above,  the 
11. 
 
findings recorded by both the courts below on point of limitation 
are  not  sustainable  under  the  law  and  as  such  are  reversed. 
Resultantly,  the  instant  civil  revision  is  allowed  and  the 
impugned 
judgments  &  decrees  dated  07.02.2008  and 
16.05.2002  passed  by  the  learned  first  appellate  court  and  trial 
court, respectively are set aside. The result would be the suit for 
declaration  filed  by 
the  respondents-plaintiffs  shall  stand 
dismissed with costs throughout.
