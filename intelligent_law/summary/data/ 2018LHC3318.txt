(“PPCBL”),  Multan  Zone,  vide  letter  dated  13.5.1997,  made  a 
complaint to the Additional Director, Anti-Corruption Establishment, 
Multan,  for  registration  of  criminal  case  against  the  staff  of  PPCBL, 
Khanewal Branch, for misappropriating public money. He stated that 
Mehmood Ahmad was posted as cashier in the aforesaid branch. The 
General  Manager  of  the  PPCBL,  vide  Office  Order  No.64  dated 
18.2.1997,  deputed  him  to  work  as  Field  Officer  in  the  Khanewal 
District.  The  said  Office  Order  was  received  in  the  branch  on 
22.2.1997 and when the Branch Manager asked Mehmood Ahmad to 
hand  over  the  charge  he  locked  the  cashier’s  cabin  and  went  away 
without the permission of his superiors and did not turn up till late in 
the  evening.  The  matter  was  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  General 
Manager who constituted a committee which lodged Rapt No.12 dated 
25.2.1997  at  Police  Station  City  Khanewal  about  this  incident.  On 
26.2.1997  the  aforesaid  committee  opened  the  cabin  and  found  that 
the  cash  was  short  by  Rs.16,37,544.33.  Consequent  thereupon,  the 
auditors  were  tasked  to  conduct  a  thorough  audit  of  the  branch. 
Balance  confirmation  letters  were  also  issued  to  the  account  holders 
who  lodged  claims  which  were  supported  by  their  passbooks  and 
deposit-slips.  The  auditors  found  massive  irregularities  in  the  branch 
and  reported  embezzlement  of  Rs.48,72,685/-  from  74  accounts  and 
shortage  of  Rs.16,37,544/-  in  the  cash-in-hand.  The  Audit  Report 
identified  eight  persons  who  were  involved  in  the  scam,  including, 
Haji Ghulam Rasool, Sheikh Irshad Ahmad Paracha, Mubashir Iqbal, 
Mehmood  Ahmad,  Syed  Ijaz  Abbas,  Syed  Murtaza  Hussain  Shah, 
Mian  Ghulam  Mustafa  and  Muhammad  Saleem.  On  the  basis  of  the 
said  complaint  FIR  No.138/1997  dated  26.8.1997  for  offences  under 
Sections  420/467/468/471/409  PPC  read  with  Section  5(2)  of  the 
Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1947,  was  registered  at  Police  Station 
ACE,  Multan  Region,  Multan.  The  ACE  investigated  the  case  and 
found  that  the  accused  had  committed  the  offence.  Report  under 
Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted accordingly.

The  learned  Special  Court  summoned  the  afore-named 
accused  and  indicted  them.  All  of  them  pleaded  innocence  and 
claimed  trial.  During  the  course  of  trial  Mubashir  Iqbal  and  Irshad 
Ahmad Paracha passed away so proceedings against them abated. 
4. 
The  prosecution  cited  94  witnesses  in  the  calendar  of 
witnesses. Out of them testimony of 31 witnesses, including six from 
the  PPCBL,  was  recorded  when  the  learned  trial  Court  vide  three 
separate  orders  dated  4.2.2009,  7.2.2009  and 13.2.2009  acquitted  the 
accused.  The  PPCBL  has  filed  Crl.  Appeal  Nos.169/2009,  186/2009 
and  187/2009  under  Section  417(2A)  Cr.P.C.  against  these  orders 
challenging their acquittal. 
Crl. Appeal No.169/2009 
Order  dated  13.2.2009  impugned  in  this  appeal  reads  as 
5. 
 
under: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Precisely,  the  allegation  against  Rao  Mehmood  Ahmad  and  Ijaz 
Abbas 
and 
Rs.14,97,386/- respectively. 
they  misappropriated  Rs.22,37,086/- 
that 
is 
“2.  
Today,  both  the  accused  have  undertaken  to  deposit  the 
afore-mentioned  amounts  in  three  installments.  Their  statements 
have been separately recorded. Keeping in view the conduct of both 
the  accused  and  the  fact  that  there  was  some  dispute  regarding 
calculation of amounts, no offence has been made out against them. 
By placing reliance on Nadir Shah vs. the State (1980 SCMR 402), 
Rao Mehmood Ahmad and Ijaz Abbas accused are acquitted. In case 
they stop payment of afore-mentioned amounts to the bank, the same 
will be recovered from them as arrears of land revenue.” 
Crl. Appeal No.186/2009 
Order dated 4.2.2009 assailed in this appeal is as follows: 
“Precisely, the allegations against Muhammad Saleem and Muntazer 
Hussain are that they misappropriated Rs.25000/- and Rs.2,34,799/- 
respectively. 
“2.  
It  has  been  admitted  on  the  record  that  all  amounts  due 
against  the  accused  were  deposited  by  them.  Had  they  any  bad 
intention they would not have deposited these amounts. In this view 
of the matter, even this is not a case of temporary embezzlement so 
far  as  Muhammad  Saleem  and  Muntazer  Hussain  accused  are

concerned.  Therefore,  Muhammad  Saleem  and  Muntazer  Hussain 
accused are acquitted of the charges.”

“Precisely  the  allegation  against  Ghulam  Rasool  is  that  he  had

that 
Rs.8,43,469/-  has  been  deposited  by  the  accused  and  the  remaining 
amount  will  be  deducted  from  his  G.P.  Fund  and  gratuity.  It  seems 
clear that Ghulam Rasool accused has fulfilled his responsibility by 
satisfying entire arrears due from him. To his extent this is not even 
a case of temporary embezzlement. Reliance in this behalf is placed 
on  Nadir  Shah  vs.  The  State  (1980  SCMR  402).  Consequently, 
Ghulam Rasool accused is acquitted of the charges.”

Arguments  
6. 
In  support  of  the  above-mentioned  appeals  Ch.  Khalid 
Mehmood Arain, Advocate, contended that the impugned orders were 
illegal,  arbitrary  and  perverse  and  were  thus  not  sustainable.  He 
argued  that,  firstly,  the  learned  Special  Court  suo  moto  invoked 
Section 249-A Cr.P.C. and acquitted the accused-respondents without 
providing  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  Appellant/Complainant  and 
issuing notice to the Public Prosecutor. Secondly, the prosecution had 
examined  31  witnesses  and  63  more  were  still  in  the  queue.  Ample 
incriminating  evidence  was  already  available  on  record  against  the 
accused-respondents  and  it  could  not  be  said  that  the  charge  against 
them  was  groundless.  The  holding  of  the  learned  Special  Court  that 
they  had no dishonest intention  to keep the  bank’s  money  with  them 
was  fallacious  and  contrary  to  record.  Lastly,  the  learned  Special 
Court had acted in haste. The law is well settled that the Courts should 
not  short  circuit 
the 
trial  and,  unless 
there  are  exceptional 
circumstances, allow the prosecution full opportunity to prove its case 
and then decide it on merits. He prayed that these appeals be accepted, 
Crl.Appeal No.169/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.186/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.187/2009 
5 
 
 
the  impugned  orders  be  set  aside  and  the  matter  be  remanded  to  the 
learned Special Court. 
7. 
The  learned  Deputy  District  Public  Prosecutor  supported 
these appeals and while adopting the arguments of the learned counsel 
for  the  Appellant  added  that  corruption  was  rampant  in  the  country 
and  its  eradication  was  possible  only  if  the  people  involved  were 
punished.  
8. 
  On the other hand, M/s Muhammad Suleman Bhatti and 
Nishat  Ahmad  Siddiqui,  Advocates,  who  represented  the  accused-
Respondents  in  Crl.  Appeal  No.  169/2009,  controverted  the  above 
contentions. They contended that the proceedings against the accused-
Respondents  were  without  jurisdiction.  The  learned  Special  Court 
could take cognizance of the alleged offence only on the complaint of 
the  Registrar  Cooperatives  (or  by  a  person  duly  authorized  by  him) 
under Section 63 of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 (the “Act”). 
In the instant case, no such complaint was ever made by the Registrar. 
They  further  contended  that  the  impugned  orders  were  based  on 
correct  appreciation  of  law  and  facts.  They  argued  that  after  getting 
the  FIR  registered  PPCBL  held  departmental  inquiry  against  the 
accused-respondents  in  which  some  of  them  were  exonerated  and 
reinstated in service. This clearly showed that the PPCBL had lodged 
the  FIR  on  the  basis  of  a  faulty  Audit  Report  and  the  charge  against 
the accused-respondents was groundless. Even otherwise, inasmuch as 
more  than  two  decades  had  elapsed  since  the  time  when  the  alleged 
offence  was  committed,  no  useful  purpose  would  be  served  in 
remanding the case to the learned trial Court. M/s Muhammad Anwar 
Awan,  Waseem  Mumtaz  and  Mehr  Ashfaq  Ahmad  Utra,  Advocates, 
who  appeared 
in  Crl.  Appeal  No.186/2009  &  Crl.  Appeal 
No.187/2009  adopted  the  arguments  of  M/s  Muhammad  Suleman 
Bhatti  and  Nishat  Ahmad  Siddiqui,  Advocates.  They  all  prayed  for 
dismissal of these appeals.

Opinion of the Court 
6 
9. 
  I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length 
and have gone through the record with their able assistance.  
10. 
  I first take up the objection relating to the legality of the 
proceedings  initiated  against  the  accused-respondents.  Admittedly, 
Ch.  Abdul  Ghafoor,  Zonal  Chief,  PPCBL,  got  registered  FIR 
No.138/1997  dated  26.8.1997  without  obtaining  sanction  from  the 
Registrar  Cooperatives  and  thereafter  the  learned  Special  Court  took 
cognizance and put them to trial. The aforesaid objection is premised 
on  Sections  63  and 70-A of the  Act  which  are  reproduced hereunder 
for ready reference: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
63. Cognizance of offences.– No court shall take cognizance of any 
offence  punishable  under  this  Act  except  on  a  complaint  in  writing 
made by the Registrar or by a person duly authorised for the purpose 
by him: 
Provided  that  cognizance  of  an  offence  under  sub-section  (2)  of 
section 62-A may be taken even otherwise than on such complaint. 
70-A. Bar of Jurisdiction.– (1) Notwithstanding anything provided in any 
other law for the time being in force, but save as expressly provided in this 
Act– 
 
(a) 
 
(b) 
no Court or other authority whatsoever shall have jurisdiction to 
entertain, or to adjudicate upon, any matter which the Provincial 
Government,  the  Registrar  or  his  nominee,  any  arbitrator  or 
liquidator,  a  society,  a  financing  bank,  a  Co-operative  bank  or 
any other person is empowered by or under this Act, or the rules 
or by-laws framed thereunder, to dispose of or to determine; 
the  validity  of  anything  done  or  an  order  passed  by  the 
Provincial  Government,  a  society,  a  financing  bank,  a  Co-
operative  bank,  the  Registrar  or  any  other  person  referred  to  in 
clause  (a),  under  this  Act  or  the  rules  and  by-laws  framed 
thereunder,  shall  not  be  called  in  question  in  any  manner 
whatever before or by any Court or other authority whatsoever; 
and 
 
(c) 
no Court or other authority whatsoever shall be competent to grant 
any injunction or pass any other order in relation to any proceedings 
under this Act or any rules or by-laws framed thereunder before the 
Provincial Government, a society, a financing bank, a Co-operative 
bank, the Registrar or any other person referred to in clause (a). 
The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable to proceedings, 
(2) 
appeals and revisions pending adjudication or disposal before or in any Court 
or  other  authority  whatsoever  on  the  date  that  the  Co-operative  Societies 
(Amendment)  Ordinance,  1966,  comes  into  force,  and  any  order  passed  in 
such  proceedings,  whether  before  or  after  the  coming  into  force  of  the  said 
Ordinance,  in  regard  to  matters  referred  to  in  sub-section  (1),  shall  stand 
vacated and be without any force.

11. 
It  is  well  settled  that  the  provisions  seeking  to  oust  or 
restrict  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  are  to  be  construed  strictly  or 
with  a  pronounced  leaning  against  ouster/restriction.  Further,  unless 
very explicit words are used in the statute itself in that behalf such an 
intention would not normally be imputed to the Legislature. Reliance 
is  placed  on  Abbasia  Cooperative  Bank  (now  Punjab  Provincial 
Cooperative  Bank  Ltd.)  through  Manager  and  another  v.  Hakeem 
Hafiz Muhammad Ghaus and 5 others (PLD 1997 SC 3). 
12. 
In  the  instant  case,  a  bare  reading  of  Section  63  would 
show  that  it  bars  a  Court  from  taking  cognizance  of  the  offences 
punishable under the Act. The said offences have been enumerated in 
Sections 60, 61 & 62 thereof. It does not apply to offences under the 
general  law  or  any  special  law.  Similarly,  Section  70-A  bars 
jurisdiction  of  the  Court  only  in  respect  of  the  matters  which  fall 
within the domain of the provincial government, the Registrar (or his 
nominee),  an  arbitrator,  a  liquidator,  a  society,  a  financing  bank,  a 
cooperative  bank  under  the  Act.  The  offences  under  Sections  420, 
467, 471, 409  PPC and  Section 5(2)  of the  Prevention  of  Corruption 
Act,  1947,  do  not  fall  in  this  category.  In  other  words,  complaint  in 
terms of Section 63 is required for prosecution of offences under the 
Act, viz, offences mentioned in Section 60, 61 and 62 thereof and not 
in  respect  of  the  other  offences.  This  view  was  expressed  in  Sindhi 
Cooperative  Housing  Society  Ltd.,  etc.  v.  The  Superintendent  of 
Police, etc. (NLR 1990 Criminal 504), Hamdard Cooperative Society 
v. Government of Sindh and others (1990 MLD 1060) and Mubarak 
Hussain  Siddiqui  and  another  v.  Sajjad  Hassan  Khan  and  another 
(PLD 1992 Kar. 167) which was eventually approved by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Mian Khan v. Ghulam Mustafa and 6 
others (1996 SCMR 654) where the appellant challenged the inquiry 
initiated  by  the  ACE  on  the  basis  of  Sections  63  &  70A,  ibid.  The 
Apex Court explained: 
Crl.Appeal No.169/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.186/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.187/2009 
8 
 
 
 
“It  is  quite  clear  from  reading  of  Section  63  of  the  Act  that 
jurisdiction of ordinary Courts to take cognizance of an offence has 
been ousted only in  respect  of offences which are punishable under 
the Act and this ouster of jurisdiction too ceases to be applicable as 
soon  as  a  written  complaint  is  filed  by  the  Registrar  or  a  person 
authorized  by  him  in  this  behalf,  before  the  Court.  However,  in 
respect  of  offences  punishable  under  any  other  law,  the  jurisdiction 
of ordinary Court to take cognizance is not at all affected by Section 
63  of  the  Act.  The  offences  and  penalties  prescribed  therefor  under 
the  Act  are  stated  in  Sections  60  to  62  of  the  Act.  Therefore,  if  a 
question  arises  whether  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  to  take 
cognizance of an offence is barred under Section 63 of  the Act, the 
Court has to determine whether the allegations constituted an offence 
punishable under the Act or not. If the answer to this question is in 
the  affirmative  the  Court  will  stay  its  hand  in  the  matter  until  such 
time a written complaint is filed before it by the Registrar or a person 
authorized by him in this behalf. However, if the answer to the above 
question is returned by the Court in the negative, the Court may take 
cognizance in the matter and proceed further.” 
13. 
In  support  of  his  contention  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
accused-respondents  relied  on  Khanzada  Hadayat  Ali  Khan  v. 
Mazhar  Ali  Khan  and  others  (1985  PCr.LJ  2871)  but  the  same  is 
distinguishable.  In  the  said  case  the  accused  were  members  of  the 
Managing  Committee  or  Secretary  of  the  Model  Town  Cooperative 
Society  Ltd.  and  the  dispute  touched  the  business  and  internal 
management  of  the  society.  It  is  now  well  settled  that  a  dispute 
touching  the  business  of  society,  between  member  or  members  and 
the past members of the society or between members and the society 
or  its  Committee,  is  quite  distinct  and  separate  from  the  allegations 
which discloses an offence against the office bearers of the society. In 
Mian Khan’s case (supra), the Apex Court explained: 
 
“The  provisions  contained  in  Sections  54  and  63  of  the  Act  are 
attracted  in  different  context  and  situations.  Section  54  is  not 
attracted in a case where allegations are that an officer or the office-
bearer  of  the  Cooperative  Society  has  committed  an  act  which  is 
punishable  under  Pakistan  Penal  Code  or  under  some  other  law. 
Similarly,  Section  70-A  of  the  Act  bars  jurisdiction  of  all  other 
Courts and authorities to entertain or to  adjudicate upon any matter 
which  the  Provincial  government,  Registrar  or  his  nominee,  any 
arbitrator,  a  liquidator,  a  Society,  a  financing  bank,  a  Cooperative 
Bank or any other person is empowered by or under the Act or rules 
or  bye-laws  framed  thereunder,  to  dispose  or  to  determine.  Here 
again  the  condition  precedent  to  attract  the  application  of  ouster 
clause  is  that  the  matter  in  issue  is  such  which  the  Registrar,  the 
Provincial  Government  or  Registrar’s  nominee  is  authorised  under 
the  provisions  of  the  Act  to  decide  or  adjudicate  upon.  This 
Crl.Appeal No.169/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.186/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.187/2009 
 
 
9 
provision  also  cannot  be  pressed  into  service,  if  the  allegations 
against the officer or office-bearer of the Society disclose an offence 
which is punishable under a law other than the Act. ” 
14. 
It is pertinent to add that Section 65-B of the Act stipulates 
that every officer of a society, including a co-operative bank, shall be 
deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 PPC. 
In  this  view  of  the  matter,  case  FIR  No.138/1997  was  exclusively 
triable by the Special Court, Anti-Corruption, and the learned Special 
Judge  rightly  assumed  jurisdiction.  Resultantly,  all  objections  of  the 
accused-respondents with regard to legality of the proceedings before 
him are repelled. 
15. 
  Now  I  attend  to  the  challenges  laid  to  the  impugned 
orders  by  the  Appellant.  Section  6(3)  of  the  Pakistan  Criminal  Law 
(Amendment) Act, 1958, stipulates that the provisions of Chapter XX 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, shall apply to trial of cases 
by  the  Special  Courts  constituted  thereunder  unless  they  are 
inconsistent with it. Admittedly, in the instant case the learned Special 
Court invoked Section 249-A Cr.P.C. suo moto to acquit the accused-
respondents. They did not make any application for this purpose. The 
said Section reads as under: 
 
249-A.  Power  of  Magistrate  to  acquit  accused  at  any  stage.- 
Nothing  in  this  Chapter  shall  be  deemed  to  prevent  a  Magistrate 
from acquitting an accused at  any stage of the case if, after hearing 
the  prosecutor  and  the  accused  and  for  reasons  to  be  recorded,  he 
considers that the charge is groundless or that there is no probability 
of the accused being convicted of any offence. 
16. 
Relying  on  M.  Saleem  Anjum  v.  Majid  Nizami  and  4 
others  (1990  MLD  206)  and  The  State  v.  Muhammad  Afzal  and 
another  (2000  MLD  220)  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant 
argued  that  suo  moto  action  of  the  learned  Special  Court  was  inapt. 
The  learned  counsel  for  the  accused-respondents  rebutted  this 
argument  with  the  submission  that  the  language  of  Section  249-A 
Cr.P.C.  does  not  bar  the  trial  Court  to  exercise  the  power  conferred 
thereunder on its own if the circumstances permit. He maintained that 
Crl.Appeal No.169/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.186/2009 
Crl.Appeal No.187/2009 
10 
 
 
a  formal  application  by  the  accused  is  not  a  pre-condition  for  this 
purpose.  It  is  not  necessary  for  this  Court  to  give  its  opinion  on  this 
controversy  because  it  is  admitted  on  all  hands  that  the  impugned 
orders  were  passed  without  issuing  notice  to  the  learned  prosecutor 
and  affording  him  an  opportunity  of  hearing  which  was  mandatory. 
The following observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case 
cited as The State v. Sarwar Khan and others (PLD 1984 SC 428) are 
quite instructive: 
 
 
“Further, while recording an order under Section 249-A Cr.P.C. the 
Court  should  afford  an  opportunity  to  the  prosecutor  before 
recording an order of acquittal and that can be done either by issuing 
a show-cause why such an order be not recorded.” 
The  cases  of  Mst.  Naseem  Akhtar  v.  Murad  Ali  and 
others  (1986  PCr.LJ  1824),  Muhammad  Saleem  v.  Muhammad 
Ismail and another (1987 PCr.LJ 1633) and The State through A.G., 
N.W.F.P. v. Abdul Latif and another (1990 PCr.LJ 113) reiterate the 
above principle. 
17. 
  There  are  ample  authorities  on  the  point  that  the 
expression “at any stage” used in Section 249-A Cr.P.C. indicates that 
the  Court  may  exercise  the  powers  conferred  on  it  thereunder  at  the 
very initial stage, after taking cognizance or in the middle of the trial 
after recording some evidence or later before the judgment is handed 
down.  For  purposes  of  illustration  reference  may  be  made  to  State 
through  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Interior  v.  Ashiq  Ali  Bhutto  (1993 
SCMR 523) and Muhammad Khalid Mukhtar v. The State through 
Deputy  Director,  F.I.A.  (C.B.A.),  Lahore  (PLD  1997  SC  275). 
However,  the  said  power  must  be  used  sparingly  and  every  possible 
opportunity should be afforded to the prosecution to prove its case and 
establish  guilt  of  the  accused.  In  The  State  through  Advocate-
General, Sindh High Court of Karachi v. Raja Abdul Rehman (2005 
SCMR 1544), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held: 
 
“This  Court  in  the  cases  of  Bashir  Ahmad  v.  Zafar  ul  Islam  PLD 
2004 SC 298 and Muhammad Sharif v. The State and another PLD

1999  SC  1063  did  not  approve  decision  of  criminal  cases  on  an 
application  under  Section  249-A  Cr.P.C.  or  such  allied  or  similar 
provisions of law, namely, Section 265-K Cr.P.C. and observed that 
usually  a  criminal  case  should  be  allowed  to  be  disposed  of  on 
merits…”

Perusal of the record reveals that the prosecution had cited 
94  witnesses  in  the  calendar  of  witnesses.  At  the  time  when  the 
impugned orders were passed it had examined 31 which included six 
from the PPCBL. A wade through their depositions reveals that there 
was sufficient incriminating material against the accused-respondents. 
The  remaining  63  witnesses  were  yet  to  be  recorded.  In  the 
circumstances,  it  could  not  be  said  that  the  charge  against  them  was 
groundless and there was no probability of their being convicted – the 
only  basis  on  which  Section  249-A  Cr.P.C.  could  be  invoked.  The 
learned Special Judge has not addressed this legal issue in any of the 
impugned  orders.  It  appears  that  he  was  swayed  by  the  fact  that  the 
accused-respondents had returned the money that they were alleged to 
have  misappropriated.  In  law  this  may  be  a  ground  for  lesser 
punishment but not acquittal. 
19. 
  I have noted that in Crl. Appeal No.169/2009 the learned 
Special  Judge  acquitted  Mehmood  Ahmad  and  Ijaz  Abbas  on  the 
ground  that  there  was  some  dispute  between  them  and  PPCBL 
regarding  calculation  of  amounts.  Similarly, 
in  Crl.  Appeal 
No.187/2009 he recorded a finding that the prosecution had not been 
able  to  prove  even  the  charge  of  temporary  embezzlement  against 
Ghulam Rasool. The said findings are arbitrary and are not based on 
any  evidence.  The  learned  Special  Judge’s  reference  to  the  case  of 
Nadir  Shah  v.  The  State  (1980  SCMR  402)  is  inapt  and  has  no 
relevance to the facts and circumstances of the instant case. 
20. 
  It  has  been  brought  to  the  notice  of  this  Court  that  after 
getting  the  FIR  registered  PPCBL  held  departmental  inquiry  against 
the accused-respondents in which some of them were exonerated and

reinstated  in  service.  I  am  afraid,  this  has  no  bearing  on  the  instant 
case  which  has  to  be  decided  on  its  own  merits.  In  State  through 
Prosecutor-General,  Punjab  v.  Jahangir  Akhtar  and  others  (2018 
SCMR 733), the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed: 
 
“The impugned orders passed by the trial court in the Respondents’ 
cases show that the trial court was labouring under a misconception 
that  on  account  of  compulsory  retirement  of  the  Respondents  from 
service they could not be criminally prosecuted for the same matter 
as such prosecution was to amount to double jeopardy attracting the 
provision of Article 13(a) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 and Section 403 Cr.P.C. and even the High Court 
had agreed with the said opinion. It had not been appreciated by the 
courts  below  that  disciplinary  action  taken  by  a  department  and 
criminal  prosecution  are  quite  distinct  from  each  other  and  can 
proceed  simultaneously  or  one  after  the  other  and  such  separate 
actions do not attract the principle of double jeopardy. It has already 
been  clarified  by  this  Court  in  many  a  precedent  case  that 
disciplinary  proceedings  are  meant  solely  for  maintaining  and 
ensuring purity of service whereas criminal  prosecution is  meant  to 
punish  a  person  for  the  offence  committed  by  him  and  that  in  a 
proper  case  departmental  and  criminal  proceedings  can  proceed 
simultaneously or one after the other.”  
21. 
  It  is  true  that  the  principles  governing  the  decision  of 
appeal  against  acquittal  are  different  from  an  appeal  filed  against 
conviction.  The  Appellate  Court  should  interfere  in  an  order  for 
acquittal  only  where  the  trial  Court  has  committed  grave  irregularity 
which  has  caused  miscarriage  of  justice.  However,  an  accused 
acquitted under Section 249-A or 265-K Cr.P.C. stands on a different 
pedestal.  In  this  respect  I  am  guided  by  the  law  laid  down  by  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  Raja  Abdul  Rehman’s  case 
(supra): 
 
 
“It  will  not  be  out  of  place  to  mention  that  in  appeal  or  revisional 
proceedings,  the  order  of  acquittal  of  the  accused  under  Section  
249-A or 265-K of the Cr.P.C. would not have the same sanctity as 
orders of acquittal on merits. Consequently, the principles which are 
to  be  observed  and  applied  in  setting  aside  concurrent  findings  of 
acquittal  or  the  principle  relating  to  the  presumption  of  double 
innocence  when  an  accused  is  acquitted  after  a  full-fledged  inquiry 
and  trial  to  acquittals  under  Section  249-A  Cr.P.C.  would  not  be 
applicable.”

Conclusion  
13 
22. 
In view of what has been discussed above, in my opinion, 
the  impugned  orders  are  patently  illegal,  perverse  and  thus  not 
sustainable.  Resultantly,  Crl.  Appeal  Nos.  169,  186  and  187  of  2009 
are  accepted  and  the  impugned  orders  of  acquittal  of  the  accused-
respondents  are set  aside. The  case  is  remanded to  the  Special Court 
which shall proceed with the trial from the stage when the impugned 
orders were passed and conclude the same within the shortest possible 
time.
