12.12.2018. 
Mr. Shafqat Saleem Khokhar, Advocate. 
Ch. Abid Hussain, Advocate. 
SHAKIL-UR-REHMAN KHAN, J:- The brief facts leading to the 
filing of  the  instant  writ  petition  are  that  vide  judgment  and decree 
dated 14-9-2015, the learned Family Court, partially decreed the suit

The  petitioner  challenged  the  said  judgments  &  decrees 
through Writ Petition No.2705/2016 which was decided in terms of 
order dated 24.5.2017 in the following terms:- 
“This  petition  calls  into  question  decrees  of  the  learned  Courts 
below whereby maintenance allowance of respondents No.1 and 2 
was determined. 
2. 
During  the  course  of  arguments  learned  counsel  for  the 
parties  entered  into  compromise  and  jointly  submit  that  the 
petitioner  has  already  deposited  Rs.250,000/-  out  of  the  decretal 
amount  with  the  Deputy  Registrar  (Judl)  of  this  Court;  that  by 
allowing  C.M.No.83  of  2017  the  Deputy  Registrar  (Judl)  be 
directed  to  pay  Rs.250,000/-  to  respondents  No.1  and  2  after  due 
verification and proper receipt; that petitioner be directed to pay a 
further  amount  of  Rs.150,000/-  to  respondents  No.1  and  2  within 
three  months  from  today  for  the  full  and  final  satisfaction  of  the 
decree;  that  on  payment  of  Rs.150,000/-  within  three  months  by 
the petitioner the decree would stand satisfied otherwise the decree 
of  the  learned  Courts  below  shall  stand  revived  and  respondents 
No.1 and 2 shall have a right to get it executed; and, that in terms 
of above this petition be disposed of. 
3. 
Order accordingly.” 
In view of the above, the petitioner / judgment debtor got paid 
the  sum  of  Rs.150,000/-  and  the  following  order  was  passed  on 
29.9.2017 by the learned Executing Court:- 
“Learned counsel for the judgment debtor states that they are ready 
to  pay  Rs.1,50,000/-  to  the  decree  holder  as  per  direction  of 
Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench,  Rawalpindi,  in 
writ  petition  No.2705/2016  dated  24.05.2017.  The  father  of  the 
judgment debtor has paid amount of Rs.1,50,000/- to the father of 
decree  holder  who  received  the  same  and  endorse  his  thumb 
impression and signature in token of the receipt of said amount. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  decree  holder  maintained  that  in 
2. 
the  light  of  direction  of  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi 
Bench,  Rawalpindi  dated  24.05.2017  the  instant  decree  has 
satisfied. I have perused the order of Hon’ble Lahore High Court, 
Rawalpindi  Bench,  Rawalpindi  dated  24.05.2017  passed  in  writ 
petition  No.2705/2016  vide  above  said  order  the  Hon’ble  court 
directed the judgment debtor as follows:- 
“That  petitioner  be  directed  to  pay  a  further  amount  of 
Rs.1,50,000/-  to  respondents  No.1  and  2  within  three 
months from today for the full and final satisfaction of the 
decree;  that  on  payment  of  Rs.1,50,000/-  within  three 
months  by  the  petitioner  the  decree  would  stand  satisfied 
otherwise  the  decree  of  the  learned  Courts  below  shall 
stand revived and respondents No.1 and 2 shall have a right 
to get it executed.” 
W.P. No.652/2018

3. 
Perusal of the above said direction of Hon’ble Lahore High 
Court, Rawalpindi  Bench Rawalpindi  clearly  give the direction to 
the  judgment  debtor  to  pay  Rs.1,50,000/-  to  decree  holder  within 
three  months  from  today  i.e.  24.05.2017  which  means  that  the 
period of three months has reckoned on 24.08.2017. 
4. 
As  per  record  the  judgment  debtor  has  badly  failed  to 
comply  the  direction  of  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi 
Bench Rawalpindi in its letters and spirits. As the judgment debtor 
has failed to  comply the direction of Hon’ble  Lahore High Court, 
Rawalpindi  Bench  Rawalpindi  vide  order  dated  24.05.2017. 
Therefore,  in  the  light  of  the  said  order  now  the  decree  of  trial 
court shall stand in field and same shall be executed.  
Now to come up for further payments for 03.11.2017.” 
The  above  noted  order  dated  29.9.2017  was  challenged 
through appeal which was dismissed vide judgment & decree dated 
20.11.2017.  The  petitioner  /  judgment  debtor  has  challenged  the 
order  dated  29.9.2017  as  well  as  judgment  &  decree  dated 
20.11.2017 through the instant writ petition.  
2. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  stated  that  a  compromise 
had been entered into by the petitioner and the respondent Nos.1 and 
2 whereby it was agreed that a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- when paid shall 
be taken as full and final settlement of decree dated 30.8.2016 and it 
had  to  be  paid  within  three  months  and  on  the  basis  of  the  said 
compromise,  the  Writ  Petition  No.2705/2016  was  disposed  of;  he 
stated  that  the  petitioner  /  judgment  debtor  immediately  contacted 
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for paying the said amount but they insisted 
to  receive  it  in  the  learned  Executing  Court.  The  father  of  the  said 
respondent No. 1 did not turn up before the learned Executing Court 
on  09.6.2017  and  14.7.2017  and  the  case  was  adjourned  to 
29.9.2017 due to the summer vacations in the month of August; he 
further  pointed  out  that  the  respondent  Nos.1  and  2  had  also 
submitted  a  schedule  of  payment  and  the  execution  proceedings 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 4 
were  adjourned  for  the  reply  thereto  and  the  matter  was  fixed  for 
29.9.2017; he added that the real father of the petitioner / judgment 
debtor, in his capacity as attorney offered to pay the said amount and 
the  father  of  the  respondent  No.1,  in  the  presence  of  his  counsel, 
without  any  objection  received  the  same.  Moreover,  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  decree  holder  made  a  statement  before  the  said 
learned  Executing  Court  to  the  effect  that,  in  the  light  of  the 
direction  of  the  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench, 
Rawalpindi dated 24.5.2017 the instant decree has been satisfied; he 
vehemently argued that in view of the above circumstances and the 
statement of the learned counsel for the decree holder, the execution 
petition should have been disposed of but unfortunately the  learned 
Executing  Court  revived  the  decree  dated  14.9.2015;  he  next 
contended  that  the  petitioner  /  judgment  debtor  challenged  the  said 
order dated 29.9.2017 in appeal which was unfortunately dismissed 
vide judgment & decree dated 20.11.2017, hence this writ petition.  
His  first  objection  was  that  learned  District  Court  committed  an 
illegality by issuing a decree sheet in execution proceedings, which 
was not only illegal but also amounts to issuing two decrees in one 
suit; he further  contended that  the payment  was  made  and  received 
in  accordance  with  the  direction  of  this  Court  and  the  offer  was 
accepted  by  the  father  of  the  respondent  Nos.1  and  2  without  any 
objection  and  with  free  will.  Moreover,  no  objection  regarding 
alleged delay was raised by the father of respondent Nos.1 and 2 or 
their  learned  counsel  and  that  they  never  insisted  for  execution  of 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 5 
the decree; he then threw the challenge to the order dated 29.9.2017 
and  contended  that  the  same  is  not  sustainable  in  the  eyes  of  law 
because the respondent Nos.1 and 2 alongwith their counsel made a 
statement  about  the  satisfaction  of  the  decree  but  unfortunately  the 
learned Courts below are bent upon to execute a decree which stands 
satisfied  with  the  concurrence  of  the  contesting  parties;  he  then 
contended  that  the  learned  Executing  Court  as  well  as  the  learned 
appellate  Court  lost  sight  of  the  fact  that  in  the  earlier  round  vide 
judgment  &  decree  dated  30.8.2016  the  judgment  &  decree  of  the 
learned  trial  Court  dated  14.9.2015  was  modified  but  unfortunately 
both  the  learned  Courts  below  are  now  putting  in  their  efforts  to 
execute  the  decree  dated  14.9.2015;  he  further  stated  that  the 
impugned  order  and  the  judgment  &  decree  cannot  supersede  the 
order  dated  24.5.2017  passed  in  W.P.  No.2705/2016.  The  said 
learned Courts below lost sight of the fact that only the decree of the 
learned  appellate  Court  dated  30.8.2016  had  been  challenged  in 
W.P.  No.2705/2016;  he  further  contended  that,  without  conceding 
mere  delay  if  any  could  have  been  easily  condoned  in  view  of  the 
fact  that  regular  periodical  payments  were  being  made  by  the 
petitioner  /  judgment  debtor  without  any  fail  after  the  order  passed 
by  this  Court,  that  too,  had  an  objection  been  raised  regarding 
limitation of 3 months by the decree holders / respondent Nos.1 and 
2; he then stated that, again without conceding the delay, if any was 
beyond  the  control  of  the  petitioner  /  judgment  debtor  due  to  long 
adjournment  for  summer  vacations  and  the  insistence  of  the 
respondent  Nos.1  and  2  to  receive  the  requisite  amounts  in  the 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 6 
Court.  His  next  argument  was  that  both  the  learned  Courts  below 
have  exercised 
their 
jurisdiction  with  material 
irregularities, 
illegalities  and  the  same  are  based  on  surmises  and  conjectures  as 
well  as  result  of  mis-reading  of  the  material  on  record.  Today,  he 
also  placed  the  certified  copy  of  the  order  sheet  of  the  learned 
Executing Court, on record. The learned counsel for the respondent 
Nos.1 and 2 has also seen the same and has no objection if the same 
is  taken  on  record  of  the  instant  case.  Learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner  then  pointed  out  that  on  09.6.2017  and  14.7.2017  the 
father  of  the  respondent  No.1  was  not  present  and  the  matter  was 
fixed for 29.9.2017 but this aspect of the matter was not taken into 
consideration  while  passing  the  impugned  order  and  the  impugned 
judgment & decree challenged before this Court through the instant 
writ petition. He further explained that the delay was only due to the 
Holidays and therefore, the time period fixed by this Court through 
the  order  of  the  earlier  writ  petition  could  not  be  complied  with, 
particularly  when  respondent  Nos.1  and  2  wanted  to  collect  said 
amount  only  in  Court;  he  further  contended  that  the  decree  holder 
had  not  challenged  the  said  aspect  of  the  matter  before  the  learned 
Executing  Court  and  had  they  challenged  it,  the  petitioner  / 
judgment debtor would not have deposited the said money.  
3. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  Nos.  1  and  2  states  that 
the petitioner / judgment debtor is not paying the future maintenance 
since  last  three  months.  He  further  stated  that  the  petitioner  / 
judgment  debtor  never  offered  the  said  amount  of  money,  out  of 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 7 
Court  and  that  the  father  of  the  said  respondent  No.  1  is  not  her 
attorney in the execution proceedings. 
 
In  rebuttal  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  /  judgment 
debtor argued that all the points raised by the learned counsel for the 
respondent Nos.1 and 2 are at best factual controversies. 
4. 
I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  gone 
through the record with their able assistance. 
5. 
It  transpires  from  the  record  that  the  suit  for  recovery  of 
dowry  articles or  their  price in  the  alternative, recovery  of  delivery 
expenses of respondent No.2, recovery of maintenance allowance of 
respondent No.1, recovery of  maintenance allowance of respondent 
No.2  with  annual  increase  and  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance 
for  Iddat  period  of  the  respondent  No.1  was  partially  decreed  vide 
judgment  &  decree  dated  14.9.2015.  The  appeals  filed  by  the 
petitioner  as  well  as  respondent  Nos.1  and  2  were  decided  vide 
judgment  &  decree  dated  30.8.2016.  The  learned  appellate  Court 
partially accepted both the appeals while modifying the judgment & 
decree dated 14.9.2015 passed by the learned Family Court as noted 
above  in  detail.  The  petitioner  had  earlier  challenged  the  same 
through  a  Writ  Petition  No.2705/2016  which  was  decided  in  terms 
of order dated 24.5.2017, as noted above. It is also necessary to note 
here  that  the  respondent  No.1  and  the  petitioner  were  married  on 
23.3.2007 and Rukhsati took place on 28.3.2007. Subsequently, the 
petitioner  went  to  Australia  in  June  2007. In  March  2008, he  came 
back  to  Pakistan  and  in  April  2008  the  respondent  No.1  was 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 8 
expelled from his house. Respondent No.2 was born on 08.12.2008 
and respondent No.1 was divorced on 16.02.2012. The above noted 
suit was filed by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 on 10.7.2012. This suit 
was  decreed  to  the  extent  of  delivery  expenses  at  the  rate  of 
Rs.8,000/-  and  the  maintenance  allowance  of  the  respondent  No.2 
was  decreed  at  the  rate  of  Rs.7,000/-  from  08.12.2008  uptill  her 
legal  entitlement  with  10%  annual  increase.  The  learned  appellate 
Court vide judgment & decree dated 30.8.2016, while upholding the 
judgment & decree of the learned Family Court, modified the same 
and  held  that  the  respondent  No.1  is  also  entitled  to  recover 
maintenance  allowance.  However,  it  reduced  the  maintenance 
allowance  of  the  minor  /  respondent  No.2  from  Rs.7,000/-  to 
Rs.5,000/- per month. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  this  Court  vide  order  dated  24.5.2017 
passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.2705/2017  noted  the  terms  and 
conditions  of  the  conditional  compromise  between  the  parties.  The 
main  condition  for  the  said  full  and  final  satisfaction  of  the  decree 
was  the  payment  of  Rs.150,000/-  within  three  (3)  months  by  the 
petitioner, otherwise the decrees of the learned Courts below were to 
stand revived.  
6. 
In  this  view  of  the  matter  and  the  arguments  of  the  learned 
counsel for the parties, it is imperative to note the relevant statutory 
provisions relating to a  money decree passed by the learned Courts 
below. The relevant provision being Section 13 of the Family Courts 
Act, 1964 provides as follows: - 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 9 
“13.  Enforcement  of  decrees.–  (1)  The  Family  Court  shall  pass  a 
decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, and 
shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register.  
(2)  If  any  money  is  paid  or  any  property  is  delivered  in  the 
presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall 
enter  the  fact  of  payment  or  the  delivery  of  property,  as  the  case 
may be, in the aforesaid register. 
(3)  Where  a  decree  relates  to  the  payment  of  money  and  the 
decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court not 
exceeding  thirty  days,  the  same  shall,  if  the  Court  so  directs,  be 
recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid 
to the decree-holder.  
(4) The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by such 
other Civil  Court as the  District  Judge may, by special or  general 
order, direct.  
(5) A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money to 
be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such installments as 
it deems fit.” 
7. 
The Family Court Rules, 1965 framed under the Section 26 of 
the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides as follows:- 
“16.  In  every  suit,  on  passing  the  judgment,  a  decree  shall  be 
drawn up in Form I and shall be signed by the presiding Judge. The 
decree shall bear the seal of the Court. 
17. The Court shall maintain a register of decrees and orders in the 
form  prescribed  for  decrees  and  orders  under  the  Code  of  Civil 
Procedure, 1908. 
18.  Whenever  any  fine  is  paid  under  section  15  or  section  16  or 
money or property is deposited with or realized by the Court under 
the  Act  or  these  rules,  a  receipt  shall  be  given  in  Form  II  which 
shall be serially numbered and the counterfoil thereof shall be kept 
in the Court. 
19.  All  fines,  monies,  or  property  deposited  or  realized  and 
disbursed by the Court shall be entered in a register in Form III. 
20. Where the Court receives any amount payable to a party it shall 
cause a notice thereof to be served on the' party entitled to receive 
it and shall pay it to the party concerned within four days, so far as 
may be of his applying therefor.” 
A  joint  reading  of  the  above  go  to  show  that  a  special 
procedure has been laid down for the purposes of executing a money 
decree passed under the Family Courts Act, 1964. 
8. 
I  have  carefully  considered  the  contentions  of  the  learned 
counsel for the petitioner but in view of the record and the conduct 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 10 
of the petitioner, cannot accept the same. Even if it is  accepted that 
the  father  of  the  respondent  No.1  had  insisted  to  receive  the  said 
amount of Rs.150,000/- before the learned Executing Court, and he 
subsequently failed to appear before the learned Executing Court on 
09.6.2017  and  14.7.2017,  the  said  amount  could  have  been  easily 
deposited  before  the  learned  Executing  Court  in  compliance  of  the 
conditional  compromise  reflected  in  the  order  dated  24.5.2017  of 
this  Court.  The  order  sheet  placed  on  record  today  by  the  learned 
counsel for the petitioner and not objected to by the learned counsel 
for  the  respondent  Nos.1  and  2  clearly  show  that  on  09.6.2017  the 
case  was  simply  adjourned  to  14.7.2017  for  making  the  payment. 
This order was passed in the presence of the learned counsel for the 
parties. On 14.7.2017, again the learned counsel for the parties were 
present  and  a  schedule  for  payment  was  submitted  by  the  learned 
counsel for the respondent Nos.1 and 2 / decree holders and the case 
was adjourned to 29.9.2017 for filing reply to the same. 
It would not be out of place to mention here that the decretal 
amount  that  is  to  be  paid  according  to  the  judgments  &  decrees  of 
the learned Family Court and the learned appellate Court include:- 
(i) 
Rs.8,000/- for the delivery expenses of the respondent No.2; 
(ii)  Maintenance  allowance  of  the  respondent  No.1  at  the  rate  of 
Rs.4,000/-  from  April  2008  to  16.02.2016,  that  is  the  date 
when  she  was  divorced  and  at  the  same  rate  for  the  Iddat 
period; and 
(iii)  Maintenance  allowance  of  respondent  No.2  at  the  rate  of 
Rs.5,000/-  from  08.12.2008  till  she  is  legally  entitled  with 
10%  annual  increment  and  the  first  increment  was  to  take 
effect from January 2017.  
 
W.P. No.652/2018 
 
 
 
 
Page | 11 
Keeping in view the above and more importantly the fact that 
the conditional compromise was not fulfilled by the petitioner within 
the stipulated period and irrespective of the fact that the father of the 
respondent Nos.1 and 2 as well as their counsel had taken the sum of 
Rs.150,000/-  on  29.9.2017  without  any  objection  did  not  debar  the 
learned Executing Court from applying its  mind to the terms of the 
conditional  compromise  entered  into  by  and  between  the  parties 
before  this  Court  on  24.5.2017.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  of 
Waheed Anwar Vs. Additional District Judge and others (2017 YLR 
827) wherein the constitutional petition was dismissed for the reason 
that the conditional compromise was not followed in letter and spirit 
and as a consequence the decree was held to be executable. I am also 
surprised  to  note  that  the  petitioner  being  the  father  of  the  minor 
through his counsel contended that had the other side challenged the 
delay in making the payment, the petitioner / judgment debtor would 
not  have  deposited  the  said  money.  The  conduct  of  the  petitioner 
also  disentitles  him  of 
the  discretionary 
relief  under 
the 
constitutional  jurisdiction.  It  is  also  incorrect  on  his  part  to  argue 
that the learned  Courts below  are adamant  to  execute  the  judgment 
&  decree  dated  14.9.2015  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court.  In 
this  regard,  it  is  reiterated  that  the  judgment  &  decree  dated 
14.9.2015  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  was  upheld  but 
modified  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated  30.8.2016.  Therefore,  the 
same  is  not  dead  document.  The  conditional  compromise  was 
probably  a  one-time  window  for  the  petitioner  to  once  and  for  all 
wriggle  out  of  his  responsibilities,  particularly  towards  his  minor 
W.P. No.652/2018

daughter. I cannot help but to express my surprise to the terms and 
conditions of the same. The question is that how can a father shirk of 
his responsibilities towards the minor and who could have agreed on 
her  behalf  allowing  the  father  to  do  so.  In  any  case,  even  if  the 
conditional compromise as reflected in order dated 24.5.2017 was to 
be followed / implemented, the petitioner can only blame himself for 
not  making  the  requisite  payment  within  the  stipulated  period  of 
three  (3)  months.  In  such  view  of  the  matter,  the  arguments  of  the 
learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  are  of  no  consequence.  It  is  the 
moral as well as legal responsibility of the petitioner to provide for 
his  daughter  till  her  legal  entitlement.  The  petitioner  due  to  his 
conduct has now missed the bus.  
There  is  yet  another  aspect  that  needs  consideration.  It  is 
noted  from  the  judgment  &  decree  dated  30.8.2016  passed  by  the 
learned appellate Court about the conduct and status of the petitioner 
as follows:- 
“12.  As far as status of respondent is concerned, it is transpired 
from  the  file  that  neither  the  appellant  nor  the  respondent  had 
appeared in person before the court and both of them had produced 
evidence  through  special  attorney.  It  is  also  evident  from  the  file 
that  no  direct  evidence  has  been  tendered  by  the  appellant  to 
establish  the  financial  status  of  the  respondent  but  this  fact  is 
established  from  the  file  that  the  respondent  is  residing  abroad  in 
Australia.  Although  the  respondent  has  contended  that  he  is  in 
Australia for the purpose of getting education but this is also very 
much clear from the record that he has completed his certificate in 
Printing and Graphic Arts which means that he had completed his 
higher  education  in  Australia  in  2009.  The  statement  of  the 
respondent was recorded in the year 2015 being DW.01 wherein it 
is evident that the respondent remained in Australia till 11.2.2015 
and  no  reason  has  been  provided  that  why  he  is  living  abroad 
despite completing his education which depicts that he is there just 
to  earn  his  livelihood.  Even  otherwise,  the  respondent  had  gone 
abroad  for  getting  higher  education  that  too  is  sufficient  to 
establish that he is financially a very strong person, because in our 
society  an  ordinary  man  cannot  afford  such  sort  of  blessing  in 
shape  of  Higher  Education.  Although  the  appellant  has  failed  to 
establish that the respondent is earning Rs. 1,50,000/- but keeping

in  view  the  status  of  both  the  parties,  the  appellant  No.1  is  held 
entitled to recover maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.4000/- 
per month from April, 2008 till divorce and at the same rate for the 
period of Iddat. 
13. 
As far as minor daughter appellant No.02 is concerned, it is 
claim  of  the  appellant  through  her  appeal  that  the  maintenance 
fixed  by  the  trial  court  is  not  in  accordance  with  status  of  the 
respondent  &  is  meager  one,  whereas  the  respondent  contended 
that he is merely a student at Australia and cannot pay the granted 
maintenance allowance which should be reduced. From perusal of 
record it is evident that no direct evidence has been tendered by the 
appellant  to  establish  financial  status  of  the  respondent.  It  is 
already  discussed  in  the  preceding  paragraph  that  the  minor  was 
born in the house of parents of appellant No.1 during the period of 
Ghair Abadi, therefore, there is no justification to allow the appeal 
of  the  respondent  regarding  reduction  of  period  of  maintenance 
allowance  as  same  has  been  proved  and  established  through 
evidence  of  the  respondent.  As  far  as  quantum  of  maintenance 
allowance is concerned, there is no sufficient evidence available on 
the file to establish that the respondent is a man of strong financial 
resources  to  pay  maintenance  allowance  as  claimed  by  the 
appellant.  Even  otherwise,  age  of  the  minor  at  present  is  almost 
eight years and there is nothing on the file to establish the monthly 
expenditure of the minor as no receipt of school  or otherwise has 
been  produced  by 
the  monthly 
expenditure  of  the  minor,  therefore,  quantum  of  maintenance 
allowance  of  the  appellant  No.01  is  reduced  from  Rs.7000/-  to 
Rs.5000/-  per  month  from  the  date  of  her  birth  i.e.  8.12.2008  till 
she  is  legally  entitled  with  10%  annual  increment.  The  first 
increment  will

The  record  shows  that  nothing  was  placed  on  record  before 
the  learned  Courts  below  regarding  the  monthly  expenditure  of  the 
minor, particularly regarding schooling expenses etc. and keeping in 
view the same, the quantum of maintenance allowance was reduced 
from  Rs.7,000/-  to  Rs.5,000/-  per  month  by  the  learned  Appellate 
Court while modifying the judgment & decree passed by the learned 
Family  Court.  The  record  also  shows  that  the  petitioner  went  to 
Australia for his higher education and it is noted from the record that 
after having completed his education there, he is now working there. 
This  aspect  has  been  specifically  noted  by  the  learned  appellate 
Court in its judgment & decree dated 30.8.2016.

The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case  reported 
as  Muhammad  Asim  and  others  Vs.  Mst.  Samro  Begum  and  others 
(PLD 2018 SC 819) has held as under:- 
intentional  non-disclosure.  Muhammad  Asim 
“6. 
That  as  regards  the  learned  counsel’s  contention  that  the 
earnings of the Muhammad Asim are not known, we deprecate this 
attempt  at 
is 
employed by PAEC but elects not to disclose his position or salary; 
he thus seeks to take advantage of his own willful non-disclosure. 
Where  a  husband  is  required  to  maintain  his  wife,  former  wife 
during her iddat period or child and is required to pay maintenance, 
including the arrears of maintenance, his present and past earnings 
must be disclosed by him,  because his  financial  status  determines 
the amount of maintenance that should be awarded. In case of non-
disclosure an adverse inference can be drawn against him. Family 
judges  should  try  to  ascertain  the  salary  and  earnings  of  the 
husband/father  who  is  required  to  pay  maintenance.  Muhammad 
Asim  did  not  disclose  his  salary  and  earnings  but  considers  the 
maintenance  that  has  been  awarded  to  be  excessive.  However, 
willful non-disclosure of his earnings suggest that the maintenance 
amount  is  well  within  his  means;  his  conduct  further  betrays  that 
he  does  not  want  to  be  fair  and  has  unnecessarily  embroiled  his 
former wife and child in needless litigation. The only objective for 
assailing the judgment of the Appellate Court and then of the High 
Court  has  been  to  starve  the  needs  of  his  own  child  and  the  legal 
dues of his former wife. This is unconscionable and inexcusable.” 
It would not be out of place to note here that sub-section (4) 
of  Section  17-A  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  provides  as 
follows:- 
“17A.  Suit for maintenance. – (4)  For  purposes  of  fixing  the 
maintenance, 
the  relevant 
documentary evidence from any organization, body or authority to 
determine the estate and resources of the defendant.” 
the  Family  Court  may  summon 
In  such  view  of  the  matter  the  statutory  provision  empowers 
the  Family  Courts  to  put  in  serious  efforts  while  utilizing  its  said 
power in order to determine not only the estate but also the resources 
of the defendant, for the purposes of fixing the maintenance, in each 
and every case. 
In view of the case reported as Abdul Khaliq Vs. Sidra Khaliq 
and 3 others (2017 CLC 487), the Family Court can be approached 
for enhancement of the maintenance allowance of the minor by way

of  filing  an  appropriate  application  supported  by  the  relevant 
documents,  if  any  to  ensure  that  she  is  provided  proper  education 
and  her  other  needs.  In  the  above  background,  the  order  dated 
29.9.2017  passed  by  the  learned  Executing  Court  as  well  as  the 
judgment dated 20.11.2017 are not liable to be interfered with under 
the constitutional jurisdiction. 
The record shows that there is no effort, none whatsoever, on 
the part of the petitioner / judgment debtor to comply with the terms 
and  conditions  of  the  conditional  compromise  entered  into  by  him 
voluntarily  for  the  purposes  of  depositing  the  said  amount  of  RS. 
1,50,000/-  within the period of three months. It is also evident from 
the record that the date before which this had to be done was fixed in 
the presence  of the learned  counsel of  the  Judgment  Debtor. It  is  a 
commonly  known  fact  that  the  learned  lower  courts  observe 
holidays  in  the  month  of  August  every  year.  Such  time  period  was 
fixed  with  consent  of  the  parties  in  the  presence  of  their  learned 
counsel and they knew well what they were agreeing to, in terms of 
the timeline. Now they cannot be allowed to wriggle out of the same 
more  so  for  the  reason  that  the  matter  is  governed  by  the  Family 
Courts  Act,  1964,  the  purpose  of  which  has  been  very  clearly  laid 
down  by  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case 
reported as Saif-ur-Rehman Vs. Additional District Judge, Toba Tek 
Singh and  2  others  (2018  SCMR  1885)  wherein  it  was  held  that  a 
special forum in the shape of Family Courts with special procedure 
has been  made  for  expeditious  settlements  and  disposal  of  disputes

relating  to  marriage  and  family  affairs.  It  was  further  noted  that 
purposive rather than literal approach to the interpretation has to be 
adopted  while  interpreting  statutes  and  therefore,  the  interpretation 
which advances the purpose of the Act is to be preferred rather than 
the interpretation which defeats its objects. 
9. 
In view of the above, instant writ petition is  dismissed being 
devoid of any force. Learned Executing Court is directed to proceed 
with the execution application in accordance with law.
