Brief  facts,  as  per  application  (Ex.PA)  presented  by 
Malik Shabbir Hussain (hereinafter referred as complainant) to

Motive  of  the  occurrence  was  mentioned  as  that  earlier 
the  accused  have  committed  murder  of  eleven  persons  of  the 
complainant party and whoever comes forward as complainant 
or witness of those cases, accused persons commit his murder. 
Bilal  Hassan  deceased  of  the  case  was  an  injured  witness  in 
case  FIR  No.352/2006  registered  under  Section  302  PPC, 
Section  7  of  Anti-Terrorism  Act  whereas  Malik  Shabbir 
Hussain  was  also  the  complainant  in  case  FIR  No.689/2010 
registered under Sections 302, 148, 149 PPC, Section 7 of Anti-
Terrorism  Act,  and  he  is  complainant  of  almost  ten  cases.  
Apart  from  complainant,  Sakhawat  Ali  and  Imran  Raza 
witnessed the occurrence. 
  
On application (Ex.PA) case vide FIR No.41/2012 dated 
13.1.2012  under  Sections 302, 148,  149  PPC was  registered  at 
Police  Station  Ferozewala,  District  Sheikhupura  (Ex.PA/1).  
After  registration  of the  said  case, police  declared some  of  the 
accused  persons  as  innocent,  so  feeling  dissatisfied  with  it, 
complainant  filed  the  private  complaint  (Ex.PB)  before  the 
learned  Judicial  Magistrate  which  was  entrusted  to  learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozewala, in which the appellants 
and  their  co-accused  persons  were  summoned  and  charge 
sheeted,  to  which,  they  pleaded  not  guilty  and  claimed  trial.  
Thereafter  complainant  produced  four  prosecution  witnesses 
and also tendered reports of Chemical Examiner and Serologist, 
then  Court  also  examined  twelve  Court  witnesses.   Thereafter,

statements  of  the  accused  were  recorded  under  Section  342 
Cr.P.C.  in  which  they  refuted  the  allegations  levelled  against 
them and in reply to question that why this case against you and 
why  the  PWs  deposed  against  you?,  the  appellants  stated  as 
under: - 
Awais 
“This  case  was  got  registered  by  the  complainant 
against me due to previous enmity and to grab the land 
owned by us in our village.  Complainant of this case 
and  PWs  Sakhawat  Ali  are  close  relative,  therefore, 
PWs  Sakhawat  and  complainant  have  given  false 
evidence  against  me  to  procure  conviction.    In  fact 
Bilal Hassan deceased was the resident of Lahore but 
he  used  to  live  with  the  complainant  party.    The 
complainant party himself had murdered the said Bilal 
Hassan and I was made the scape-goat in this case for 
ulterior  motive.    The  complainant  party  has  severe 
enmity with different people of area as number of FIR 
were  existed  against  the  complainant  party  including 
murder cases by the different people and I am innocent 
in this case”. 
Arshad Ali 
The  complainant  has  falsely  been  implicated  to  me  in 
this case.  The witnesses have  deposed falsely against 
me.  All the witnesses are co-related” 
 
However,  they  did  not  opt  to  appear  under  Section  340(2) 
Cr.P.C. but opted to lead evidence in their defence.  Appellant 
Awais  produced  Qaiser  Mehmood  as  DW-1  and  Tariq 
Mehmood as DW-2. 
3. 
The  learned  trial  court  after  conclusion  of  the  trial 
convicted  and  sentenced  the  appellants  as  mentioned  above 
while  acquitted  accused  Khadija  Bibi  and  Adnan-ul-Haq  vide 
impugned judgment dated 10.12.2015. 
4. 
Learned  counsel  for the  appellants  submitted that  ocular 
account  is  comprising  upon  chance  witnesses,  who  could  not

prove their presence at the place of occurrence; ocular account 
is  contradicted  by  the  medical  evidence;  after  thorough 
investigation,  Awais  appellant  was  found  as  “not  involved  in 
the  occurrence”  and  his  name  was  placed  in  coloumn  No.2  of 
the  report  prepared  under  section  173  Cr.PC.;  impugned 
judgment  is  against  the  law  and  facts  and  result  of  misreading 
and non-reading of the evidence, therefore, the same is liable to 
be set aside and appellants deserve acquittal. 
5. 
Conversely learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by 
the  learned  counsel  for  the  complainant  has  supported  the 
impugned  judgment  to  the  extent  of  appellants.    Learned 
counsel  for  the  complainant  in  support  of  petition  for  special 
leave to appeal has submitted that order of acquittal of Khadija 
Bibi and Adnan-ul-Haq accused persons is against the law and 
facts; same is result of misreading and non-reading of evidence; 
complainant  has  proved  his  case  against  them  up  to  hilt;  and 
thus  sought  leave  to  appeal.  Whereas  in  support  of  criminal 
revision for enhancement of compensation, learned counsel for 
complainant  has  contended  that  compensation  awarded  by  the 
learned trial Court is not adequate and same may be enhanced. 
6. 
After  hearing  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  going 
through the record, it has been observed that ocular account in 
the case is comprising upon the statements of Shabbir Hussain 
complainant/PW-1 and Sakhawat Ali PW-2. They both claimed 
themselves  to  be  the  eyewitnesses  of  the  occurrence.    It  is

admitted fact that both of them are not resident of  the place of 
occurrence, neither they have any property nor any business/job 
over  there;  both  of  them  even  could  not  offer  or  establish  any 
valid reason for their presence over there at the  time and place 
of  occurrence.    So  much  so  they  remained  contradictory  on 
material  points 
in 
this 
regard, 
it  was  claim  of 
the 
complainant/PW-1 
that 
they  had  gone 
to 
the  place  of 
occurrence because they had some work in NADRA Office but 
neither NADRA Office has been shown in the site plan nor any 
detail/nature of work has been disclosed by him.  During cross 
examination, complainant/PW-1 stated that they had no work in 
the office of NADRA and took another somersault that they had 
to see someone but neither his name was disclosed nor he was 
produced  during  investigation  or  trial. 
  Similarly  PW-2 
Sakhawat  Ali  stated  that  they  came  for  NADRA  office, 
however  during  cross  examination  said  that  I  cannot  tell 
distance  between  Rachana  Shopping  Center  (i.e.  place  of 
occurrence) and office of NADRA. It was claim of complainant 
PW-1 that on the day of occurrence, they proceeded to office of 
NADRA  on  his  “Dala”  but  said  “Dala”  neither  has  been 
shown  in  the  site  plan  nor  it  has  been  produced  before  the 
police;  furthermore,  its  model,  make,  registration  number, 
colour  or  any  other  feature  could  not  be  provided  by  the 
complainant,  whereas  PW-2  Sakhawat  Ali  has  clearly  stated 
that  they  had  gone  in  his  car  at  the  place  of  occurrence  which

was being driven by Malik Shabbir Hussain complainant/PW-1; 
but  neither  said  car  has  been  shown  in  the  site  plan  nor 
produced  before  the  police;  even  registration  number,  make, 
model  or  any  other  feature  of  said  car  has  not  been  provided.  
Therefore, both these witnesses have contradicted each other on 
this  material  point.    Admittedly  both  these  witnesses  are  also 
inimical  against  the  appellants  and  other  accused  persons.  
Evidence  of  such  chance  and  inimical  witnesses  cannot  be 
relied in the circumstances of the case.  Reliance is placed upon 
the  case  of  “Mst.  Shazia  Parveen  versus  The  State”  (2014 
SCMR 1197), “Muhammad Rafique  versus  The  State”  (2014 
SCMR  1698),  “Mst.  Sughra  Begum  and  another  versus 
Qaiser  Pervez  and  others”  (2015  SCMR  1142)  and  “Arshad 
Khan versus  The State” (2017 SCMR 564).  Relevant portion 
from Arshad Khan case (supra) is being reproduced: - 
“Both  the  eye-witnesses  produced  in  this  case,  i.e.  Zahid 
Khan  complainant  (PW8)  and  Muhammad  Sadiq  (PW9) 
were very  closely related to  Mst.  Naheed Akhtar  deceased 
and  they  were  admittedly  chance  witnesses.    The  said 
witnesses had maintained before the trial Court that at the 
relevant  time  they  were  proceeding  towards  a  mosque  in 
order to offer Fajar prayers but a bare look at the site-plan 
of the place of occurrence shows that the houses of the said 
eye-witnesses  were  not  situated  close  to  the  house  of 
occurrence  and  they  were  situated  so  far  away  that  they 
could  not  find  any  mention  in  the  site  plan  of  the  place  of 
occurrence at all.  No mosque near the house of occurrence 
had  been  shown  in  the  said  site-plan  and,  thus,  the  stated 
reason  for  presence  of  the  said  eye-witnesses  near  the 
place  of  occurrence  never  stood  established  on  the  record 
through any evidence whatsoever” 
 
  
It  is  also  not  out  of  place  to  mention  here  that  in  the 
application Ex.PA parentage and other particulars of Arshad Ali 
appellant  were  not  given  and  even  during  entire  investigation

this  fact  was  not  disclosed  by  the  complainant  or  any  other 
prosecution witness.  It has come on the record through Ex.DE 
that  four  person  with  the  name  of  Arshad  Ali  resides  in  his 
village  and  in  this  state  of  affairs  identification  parade  could 
have been safe mode but the same has not been done. 
 
As  per  material  and  history  available  on  record,  these 
both  eyewitnesses  i.e.  Malik  Shabbir  Hussain  PW-1  and 
Sakhawat  Ali  PW-2  were  having  more  grudge/enmity  than 
Bilal  Hassan  with  the  accused  persons,  hence  if  they  were 
available  at  the  place  of  occurrence  in  presence  of  accused 
persons,  who  were  allegedly  armed  with  lethal  weapons  like 
Kalashnikov then they both would have been first target of the 
accused  persons;  furthermore  Sakhawat  Ali  PW-2  was  also 
witness in the same FIR No.352/2006 i.e. Ex. DF/4 (which has been 
stated  as  motive of this  occurrence)  and also in so  many  other 
cases  of  similar  nature  against  the  accused  persons  including 
case  arising out  of  FIR  No.301/2005 (Ex.DF/1)  wherein  PW-2 
Sakhawat  Ali  was  injured  witness;  similarly  complainant 
Shabbir Hussain was also complainant against accused party in 
ten other cases as well, hence if for any said reason, there was 
some need to kill someone then those would have been Shabbir 
Hussain PW-1 and Sakhawat Ali PW-2; hence on this score too, 
testimony  of  these  both  witnesses  is  not  reliable.    Reliance  is 
placed upon the case of “Rohtas Khan versus The State” (2010 
SCMR 566) and relevant portion thereof is reproduced:-

“10.  The alleged motive was against the complainant, but it 
is  noted  that  the  appellant  did  not  cause  any  injury  to  the 
complainant, though he was present within the range of firing, 
thus  it  supports  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  of 
appellant  that  P.Ws.  were  not  present  at  the  place  of 
occurrence. 
It has also come on the record that Bilal Hassan did not appear 
in that case in which he was statedly witness and in this regard, 
statement of PW-2 Sakhawat Ali PW-2 is being reproduced for 
ready reference: - 
“Bilal  Hassan  deceased  did  not  record  his 
statement in criminal case FIR 352/2006” 
 
Perusal of above mentioned statement makes it crystal clear that 
there  was  absolutely  no  reason  with  accused  persons  for 
committing  murder  of  Bilal  Hassan,  hence  motive  stands 
negated.    Moreover  when  Bilal  Hassan  has  not  appeared  as  a 
witness  in  that  case  against  the  appellants,  then  complainant 
party i.e. PW-1 Shabbir Hussain and PW-2 Sakhawat Ali might 
had grudge, disliking and motive against Bilal Hassan. 
 
Complainant  PW-1  also  filed  private  complaint  in  this 
case  and  in  his  statement  recorded  under  Section  200  Cr.P.C., 
he  introduced  two  more  accused  persons  in  this  case  namely 
Zakir  Ali  and  Aslam  and  so  much  so  he  also  stated  on  oath 
during his examination under Section 200 Cr.P.C. that accused 
Aslam fired at them with intention to commit their murder, but 
then  subsequently  appearing  as  PW-1  during  the  trial  he  again 
took  somersault  and  omitted  their  name,  and  he  was  duly 
confronted with his statement Exh.DA in this regard, in order to 
prove  dishonest  improvement  and  then  material  omission.  So

ocular  account  is  neither  believable  nor  confidence  inspiring, 
and we have reached at the conclusion that both aforementioned 
eyewitnesses are not truthful witnesses, hence cannot be relied 
upon. 
 
PW-1 Shabbir Hussain in his statement before the Court 
has stated as under: - 
“The  injury  of  abdomen  entered  from  right  side 
and  exited  from  left  side  whereas  the  head  injury 
entered from left and exited from right side” 
 
However,  if  we  go  through  the  postmortem  report  Ex.PE  and 
statement  of  Doctor  Abid  Abbas  (PW-3),  entry  wound  on 
abdomen of the deceased is from left side; whereas entry wound 
on  head  is  from  right  side,  hence  ocular  account  qua  locale  of 
injuries  narrated  by  Shabbir  Hussain  PW-1  have  been  clearly 
contradicted  by  the  medical  evidence.    It  is  the  case  of  the 
complainant/prosecution  that  deceased  received  firearm  shots 
from the distance of five feet but there is no blackening found 
on  any  wound  in  the  postmortem  report  so  medical  evidence 
has contradicted the ocular account and falsified the presence of 
the eyewitnesses at the place of occurrence. 
 
Postmortem examination over dead body of Bilal Hassan 
was  performed  by  Dr.  Abid  Abbas  PW-3  at  10.00  p.m.  on 
13.1.2012.  As per version of the complainant occurrence took 
place allegedly at 3.00 p.m.  In the postmortem report  (Ex.PE) 
time  of  death  has  been  mentioned  as  1.00  p.m.,  therefore, 
postmortem has been performed after about delay of nine hours,

for  which,  no  plausible  reason  has  come  on  the  record,  which 
fact  speaks  adverse  to  the  claim  of  prosecution  that  FIR  was 
promptly  recorded  rather it  signals  that it was  an un-witnessed 
occurrence, this time has been consumed by the prosecution for 
engaging  and  procuring  witnesses  and  then  after  consultation 
and  deliberation,  version  has  been  concocted  and  incorporated 
in  the  record  of  the case i.e. police papers.    Reliance  is placed 
upon  the  case  of  “Haroon  Shafique  versus  The  State  and 
others” (2018 SCMR 2118) 
 
In  column  of  date  and  hour  of  death  in  the  postmortem 
report, doctor has mentioned 1.00 p.m. as time of death, which 
is  quite  contrary  to  the  time  given  by  the  complainant  in 
application Ex.PA, FIR Ex.PA/1 and private complaint Ex.PB.  
This  postmortem  report  has  been 
itself  relied  by 
the 
complainant  and  he  has  annexed  the  same  with  his  complaint 
and got exhibited the same as Ex.PE during trial of the case and 
also  got  examined  doctor  as  his  witness  (PW-3)  and  never 
challenged  validity  or  veracity  of  said  content  of  postmortem 
report i.e. time of death at 1.00 p.m. before any Medical Board, 
medical  hierarchy  and  in  complaint  (Ex.PB).    Even  otherwise, 
if  we  see  the  time  mentioned  in  the  postmortem  report  by  the 
doctor between the death and postmortem, same has been given 
as 8 to 10 hours, it  coincides with the time of “death given by 
the  doctor  in  the  postmortem  report  i.e.  1:00  p.m.  and 
examination of dead body at 10:00 p.m.”, which becomes nine

hours; but if the time given in the FIR regarding death i.e. 3:00 
p.m.  is  compared  with  time  of  postmortem  i.e.  10:00  p.m.,  it 
becomes  seven  hours,  which  is  contradicted  by  the  time  given 
by the doctor i.e. 8 to 10 hours.  So, this situation clearly points 
out that occurrence has not taken place at the time as alleged by 
the complainant rather at the time mentioned in the postmortem 
report. 
7. 
As  far  as  question  of  recovery  of  Kalashnikov  at  the 
pointing out of Arshad Ali appellant is concerned, same is of no 
help to the case of prosecution because the Kalashnikov as per 
report  of  Punjab  Forensic  Science  Agency  Ex.PD.  has  not 
matched  with  the  empties  allegedly  secured  from  the  alleged 
place of occurrence. 
8. 
Coming to the question of abscondance, it is important to 
mention here that prosecution has to prove each limb of its case 
beyond  shadow  of  doubt.    We  have  gone  through  the 
proclamations of both appellants, i.e. Ex.PM, which pertains to 
Arshad Ali and Ex.PP, which is regarding Awais, these both do 
not  contain  the  period  within  which  accused  were  asked  to 
surrender  before  the  Court  rather  said  column  in  both 
proclamations  are  blank,  hence  the  mandatory  requirement  of 
the proclamation has not been fulfilled.  So these proclamations 
are  of  no  help  to  the  case  of  prosecution.    Furthermore 
abscondance  is  only  a  suspicious  circumstance  and  it  cannot 
cure the defect of substantial nature of the case of prosecution.

When  ocular  account  has  been  disbelieved,  then  abscondance 
being corroboratory piece of evidence is of no help to the  case 
of  prosecution.    Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  of  “Rohtas 
Khan versus The State” (2010 SCMR 566) 
  
Although complainant did not produce copy of the FIR of 
motive case to prove the same yet appellants produced and got 
exhibited the same  as  Ex.DF/4,  which  shows that  same  cannot 
be considered as motive with appellants for committing murder 
of  Bilal  Hassan  but  same  is  reason  for  false  implication of the 
appellants  in  the  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  case.    In  this 
regard, guidance can be sought from the case of  “Tariq versus 
The State” (2017 SCMR 1672) and relevant portion whereof is 
being reproduced:- 
“The motive asserted by the prosecution indicates that there 
was  enmity  of  murder  between  the  parties  and  the  said 
enmity,  being  double  edge,  could  be  reason  for  false 
implication of the appellant” 
 
In  view  of  above,  we  have  found  that  prosecution  has 
9. 
failed to prove its case against the appellants, hence, there is no 
need to discuss defence version. 
10.  Nutshell  is  that  prosecution  could  not  establish  its  case 
against the appellants, resultantly Crl. Appeals No.9/J and 12/J 
of  2016  filed  by  appellants  are  allowed,  impugned  conviction 
and  sentence  awarded  to  the  appellants  through  the  impugned 
judgment are hereby set aside.  Appellants are acquitted of the 
charge.    They  shall  be  released  from  jail  immediately,  if  not 
required in any other case.  Murder Reference No.491/2015 is 
 
Criminal Appeal No.9/J/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.12/J/2016 
PSLA No.28/2016 
Criminal Revision No.30/2016 
Murder Reference No.491/2015 
 
 
 Appeal No. 393-2010 
14 
answered  in  negative  and  death  sentence  is  not  confirmed.   
Crl.  Revision  No.30/2016  also  stands  dismissed  for  the  above 
reasons. 
  
Now  adverting  to  PSLA  No.28/2016,  filed  by  the 
complainant, for the reasons mentioned above coupled with the 
fact  that  no  injury  has  been  allegedly  caused  by  Khadija  Bibi 
and Adnan-ul-Haq respondents of this petition and their role is 
even  otherwise,  prima  facie,  not  appealing  to  the  common 
prudence  as  effective  for  the  occurrence,  thus,  we  have  not 
found any perversity or illegality in the order of  their acquittal 
rather  same  is  quite  in  accordance  with  law  and  based  upon 
reasons borne out from the record of the case.  Even otherwise, 
after acquittal, accused attains double presumption of innocence 
and  same  can  only  be  disturbed  if  some  perversity,  capricious 
or  arbitrary  phenomena  is  found  in  the  same  but  nothing  like 
that  is  available  in  the  order  of  acquittal  of  respondents.  
Reliance  is  placed  upon  the  case  of  “Haji  Paio  Khan  versus 
Sher  Biaz  and  others”  (2009  SCMR  803).    Hence,  PSLA 
No.28/2016 is dismissed and leave is refused.
