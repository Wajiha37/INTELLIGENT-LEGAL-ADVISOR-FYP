In  this  writ  petition,  the  petitioners  have  challenged  the 
validity  of  judgment  dated  10.07.2009  passed  by  the  learned 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009

Cooperative Judge whereby petition of respondents No.1 & 2 was 
allowed  and  order dated  28.06.2007 passed by  Chairman, Punjab 
Cooperatives Board for Liquidation, Lahore was set aside.  
3. 
Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  in  the  year  1989,  Pakistan 
Development  Cooperative  Corporation  (hereinafter  called  as 
Corporation)  was  registered  under  Cooperative  Societies  Act, 
1925. That the said Cooperative Society purchased land measuring 
1674  Kanals  &  6-Marlas,  situated  in  the  Revenue  Estate  of  Top 
Kalial  &  Kaliam  Mughal,  G.T  Road,  Rawat,  Rawalpindi  and 
launched  a  Housing  Project  under  the  name  and  style  of  Quaid 
City  Housing  Project  (hereinafter  called  as  Housing  Society). 
Respondents  No.1  to  7  along-with  300  other  persons  purchased 
plots  in  the  said  society  in  the  year  1989  @  Rs.1,50,000/-  per 
Kanal.  The  Corporation  statedly  spent  more  than  20  million 
rupees  on  the  development  of  the  scheme.  The  said  Cooperative 
Society  was  taken  over  by  Punjab  Cooperatives  Board  for 
Liquidation  as  defunct  Society  under  the  Punjab  Undesirable 
Cooperative  Societies  (Dissolution)  Act,  1993  (hereinafter  called 
as Act, 1993). The said land was put to auction by the Board and 
on 09.06.2003, first advertisement was  issued in daily newspaper 
by  fixing  the  reserve  price  of  land  @  Rs.71,000/-  per  Kanal  and 
first date for bidding was fixed as 23.06.2003. Petitioner Husnain 
Cotex  Ltd.  remained  the  highest  bidder  and  the  sale  was 
confirmed  in  its  favour  by  the  Punjab  Cooperatives  Board  of 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009

Liquidation in its meeting held on 21.08.2003 but on the multiple 
complaints of the members of the society NAB probed the matter 
and on the intervention of the NAB authorities  sale was set aside 
on 22.08.2003. The second advertisement was made in daily „Din‟ 
on  04.10.2003  and  in  Daily  „Jang‟  on  05.10.2003  for  auction  of 
the  said  property  by  fixing  21.10.2003  as  the  date  of  auction. 
Petitioner  again  participated  in  auction  proceedings  and  declared 
successful as the sole bidder. The Punjab Cooperatives Board for 
Liquidation  approved  the  bid  of  Husnain  Cotex  Limited  on 
30.10.2003 and approval letter was issued on 18.11.2003 with the 
assessment  of  total  price  of  the  land  as  Rs.127,224,000/- 
(127.224-Million) and terminus date for making payment of total 
auction  price  was  conveyed  to  the  petitioners  as  17.12.2003. 
Respondents filed a complaint/petition No.7-C of 2004 before the 
learned  Cooperative Judge  challenging the  auction  of  Quaid  City 
Housing  Project.  The  learned  Cooperative  Judge  entertained  the 
said  complaint/petition  and  granted  status  quo  order  on 
05.03.2004. Despite the injunctive  order the Punjab Cooperatives 
Board  for  Liquidation  during  pendency  of  petition  approved  sale 
deed  in  favour  of  the  petitioners  on  21.12.2004.  Finally, 
Cooperative  pending  Petition  No.7-C  of  2004  was  also  disposed 
of  on  09.05.2005  by  the  Cooperative  Judge  who  remanded  the 
matter 
to 
the  Chairman,  Punjab  Cooperatives  Board  for 
Liquidation  for  fresh  decision.  In  post-remand  proceedings,  a 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016

proclamation was issued by PCBL in the Daily Newspaper „Jang‟ 
requiring the allottees of Quaid City Housing Project to appear on 
18th August, 2005 and submit their respective objections in writing 
before  the  Chairman.  Accordingly,  a  petition  was  moved  before 
Cooperative  Board  on  18.06.2005  by  M/s  Waseem  Sana  and 
others,  the  bonafide  purchasers  of  plots  in  Quaid  City  Housing 
Project,  Rawalpindi  challenging  the  auction  of  land  measuring 
1674-Kanals in favour of petitioner No.1 owned by the Quaid City 
Housing  Society.  The  Chairman,  Punjab  Cooperatives  Board  for 
Liquidation vide order dated 28.06.2007 again decided the matter 
in favour of the petitioners. The above said order of the Chairman 
was  challenged  by  the  respondents  through  petition  No.156-C  of 
2007  titled Waseem  Sana  etc., vs  Punjab Cooperatives Board  for 
Liquidation  before  the  learned  Cooperative  Judge  who  after 
adjudication  set  aside  the  auction  as  well  as  the  order  of  the 
Chairman  PCBL,  vide  judgment  dated  10.07.2009.  Hence,  this 
writ petition.  
4. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  submits  that  impugned 
judgment  is  contrary  to  the  facts  and  law;  that  the  petitioners 
participated  in  the  bidding  process  and  being  the  highest  bidder 
purchased the suit land; that there is no evidence that roads were 
already  constructed;  that  the  suit  land  is  Banjar  and  no 
development  works  were  done  within  the  scheme  by  the 
society/Quaid  City  Housing  Project  except  only  a  single  road

Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016 
 
 
5 
leading  from  the  scheme  to the  main  road; that  price  Rs.76,000/- 
per  kanal  in  October  2003  was  a  fair  offer  but  the  learned 
Cooperative  Judge  has  not  considered  the  aspect  that  the  land  is 
Banjar Qadeem and no development work was carried out at site; 
that  land  of  the  society  is  randomly  scattered  in  multiple  small 
parcels  which  is  not  beneficial  for  any  other  land  developing 
company etc. and no department of the Government including the 
Army Foundation or NESPAK, were willing to purchase the  said 
land;  that  the  petitioners  are  bonafide  auction  purchasers  of  the 
land and the Chairman, Punjab Cooperative Board for Liquidation 
through well-reasoned order dismissed the prayer/objections of the 
respondents  and  rightly  maintained  the  sale  through  auction  in 
favour  of  the  petitioners  whereas  the  learned  Cooperative  Judge 
has  not  considered  the  document  appended  with  the  petition  and 
without  perusing  the  documentary  evidence  set  aside  the  auction 
confirmed  in  favour  of  the  petitioners,  as  such,  judgment  of  the 
learned  Cooperative  Judge  suffers 
from  perversities  and 
illegalities  which  is  not  sustainable  in  the  eye  of  law.  Further 
submits  that  non-fixing  of  reserve  price  is  merely  an  immaterial 
irregularity  which  cannot  be  considered  as  a  valid  ground  to 
nullify  the  sanctity  of  auction  as  such  the  impugned  judgment 
dated  10.07.2009  is  without  jurisdiction,  lawful  authority  and  is 
violative  of  the  legally  vested  rights  of  the  petitioners.  They 
prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the  same.  Reliance  was  placed  on  the 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016

cases  reported  as  2008  CLD  449,  2005  CLD  169,  2004  SCMR 
1956,  2012  SCMR  455,  2007  SCMR  1054,  PLD  2016  SC 
229,2010 CLC 1503, 2007 SCMR 1813 & PLD 2006 SC 538.     
5.  Mr. Khalid Ishaque learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
the  respondent/PCBL  submitted  that  reserve  price  of  the  project 
intended  to  be  auctioned  was  not  fixed  which  lacuna  invalidates 
bidding  process;  that  non-mentioning  of  reserve  price  of  land 
makes  the  determination  of  call  deposit  impossible  as  the  bank 
draft is to be received on the basis of total price of the land; that 
against  all  other  properties  meant  for  auction  through  same 
advertisement  reserve  price  was  clearly  mentioned;  that  in  the 
absence  of  determination of  the  reserve  price  the auction process 
gathers  no  sanctity  in  the  eyes  of  law  which  itself  was  based  on 
malafide,  collusiveness and  fraud and  any  superstructure  built on 
fraud  has  to  crumble  down.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases 
reported as PLD 2014 SC 283, 2013 SCMR 1419, PLD 2018 SC 
91, PLD 2013 Sindh 430.  
Further  submits  that  the  petitioners  did  not  deposit  the 
remaining  balance  amount  within  the  stipulated  period.  As  per 
advertisement  the  bidding  took  place  on  21.10.2003,  Board 
approved  the  bid  on  30.10.2003  and  approval  letter  issued  on 
18.11.2003,  as  such,  25%  amount  was  to  be  deposited  within 
seven  days  commencing  from  18.11.2003  ending  on  25.11.2003; 
that  before  publication  only  Rs.2,67,89,700/-  were  deposited  on 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016

21.10.2003,  which  itself  constituted  default  on  the  part  of  the 
petitioners  and  25%  amount  was  deposited  till  17.12.2003 
whereas the rest of amount was not deposited within the stipulated 
period  of  7  days  as  such  non-deposit  of  the  rest  of  the  amount 
frustrated  the  very  bid/auction.  Reliance  was  placed  on  the  case 
reported as 2011 SCMR 1675. Further submits that property of the 
society taken over by the PCBL was a public property and it was 
requirement  of  law  that  the  same  should  be  disposed  of  (sold) 
through  transparent  manner  to  fetch  the  maximum  price  of  the 
land in complete exclusion of any collusiveness in order to avoid 
grant  of  any  undue  favour  to  the  auction  purchaser.  Reliance  is 
placed  on  the  cases  reported  as  2012  SCMR  773,  PLD  2010  SC 
759, PLD 2010 Lhr 6052014 YLR 2571, PLD 2010 Lhr 510. The 
learned counsel further submitted that no authenticity or fairness is 
attached  to  such  auction  proceedings  which  are  illegal,  tainted 
with  malafide  and  result  of  element  of  cartelization  and  fraud. 
Moreover,  the  then  Chairman  PCBL  (Brig.)  Muhammad  Farooq 
Maan and other officials have been found involved in multifarious 
transactions brimmed with corrupt practices/corruption, nepotism, 
favouritism and deliberated misuse of authority which also vitiate 
the  sanctity  of  auction  process.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases 
reported  as  2016  SCMR  670  and  2018  SCMR  76.  Finally,  he 
submitted  that  the  learned  Cooperative  Judge  has  rightly  passed 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016 
 
 
8 
impugned  judgment  and  no  illegality  has  been  committed, 
therefore, the instant writ petition deserves dismissal.    
6.  We  have  heard  the  arguments  of  the  learned  counsels  for 
the parties  at some length and gone through the record with their 
able assistance. 
7. 
Admittedly, 
land  measuring1674  Kanals  &  6-Marlas, 
situated  in  the  Revenue  Estate  of  Top  Kalial  &  Kaliam  Mughal, 
G.T  Road,  Rawat,  Rawalpindi  was  owned  by  Pakistan 
Development  Cooperative  Corporation.  The  said  corporation 
planned and launched a Housing Project named as Quaid City. In 
response to advertisement for the above project respondents No.1 
to 7 as well as approximately 300 persons became member of the 
society and they purchased the plots @ Rs.1,50,000/- Per Kanal in 
the  year  1989  and  the  Cooperative  Corporation    constructed 
structural  metallic  road  within  the  precinct  of  the  scheme.  In  the 
year  2002,  Pakistan  Development  Cooperative  Corporation  was 
taken  over  as  defunct  society  by  PCBL  to  protect  and  safeguard 
the  interest/rights  of  the  members.  Section  7  of  the  Punjab 
Undesirable  Co-operative  Societies  (Dissolution)  Act,  1993 
explains powers of Cooperative Board to take over the properties 
of  the  defunct  society  whereas  under  Section  7  (m),  the 
Cooperative  Board  is  placed  under  obligation  to  manage  and 
develop the properties of the Undesirable Co-operative Society by 
formulating  development 
schemes  with  or  without 
the 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016

collaboration of the state development agencies and assess market 
value of the assets/properties etc. under Section 7 (n) before their 
final  disposal.  For  ready  reference,  Section  7  (m)  and  (n)  are 
reproduced as under:- 
(m)  develop  the  properties  of  an  Undesirable  Co-operative 
Society  and  for  that  purpose  to  formulate  and  execute 
development  schemes  with  or  without  the  collaboration  of 
the  official  development  agencies  and  dispose  of  assets  and 
properties; 
(n)  assess  the  market  value  of  properties  and  assets  of  an 
Undesirable Co-operative Society for their disposal. 
 
 But unfortunately without resorting to above-provision of law the 
liquidation  Board  in  a  hasty  manner  floated  a  publication  dated 
09.06.2003  putting  the  land  of  defunct  society  for  sale  through 
auction  by  fixing  reserve  price  as  Rs.71,000/-  per  Kanal,  auction 
was  conducted,  petitioner  as  the  sole  bidder  was  declared 
successful  and  ultimately  the  sale  of  the  land  was  confirmed    in 
favour of  Husnain  Cotex  Limited.  Against the  above  auction  and 
sale members of the society agitated the matter at different foras, 
ultimately said sale was set aside on 22.08.2003 on Intervention of 
NAB  whereafter  PCBL  floated  a  second  advertisement  in  daily 
„Din‟  (on  04.10.2003)  and  in  daily  „Jang‟  (on  05.10.2003)  for 
auction of the suit land and bidding date was fixed as 21.10.2003. 
Punjab Cooperatives Board for Liquidation again approved bid of 
Husnain  Cotex  on  30.10.2003  and  also  issued  confirmation  of 
auction/approval  letter  on  18.11.2003.  Total  price  of  auctioned 
land  was  calculated  as  Rs.127,224,000/-  and  terminus  date  for 
making total payment was fixed as 17.12.2003. One Waseem Sana

along with other member filed Complaint No.7-C of 2004 before 
Hon‟ble  Cooperative  Judge  who  accepted 
the  petition  on 
09.05.2005  and  by  setting  aside  the  auction  remanded  the  matter 
to the Chairman PCBL for decision in accordance with law within 
a period of 60 days and also directed that till the completion of the 
proceedings/inquiry the status of the land in question shall not be 
changed  either  by  the  PCBL  or  aforementioned  purchaser.  For 
ready  reference  relevant  part  of  the  said  order  is  reproduced  as 
under:- 
4. 
Since that exercise is not possible before this Court in 
these  proceedings,  I  will  remit  the  matter  to  the  Chairman 
PCBL,  for  a  decision  in  accordance  with  law  at  the  earliest 
either  by  himself  or  through  an  employees  of  the  Board 
having judicial experience not  below the status  of a District 
Judge  as  principal  civil  court  of  original  jurisdiction.  That 
exercise  must  be  completed  within  60  days  from  today 
irrespective of the fact that anyone or more of the parties do 
not  cooperate  or  try  to  linger  on  the  matter.  Till  the 
completion  of  the  proceedings  and  announcement  of  order 
which must happen within the aforesaid period, the status of 
the land in question will not be changed either by the PCBL 
or the aforesaid purchaser.  
In  pursuance  of  the  above  direction  the  then  Chairman  PCBL 
afforded  hearing  to  parties  and  dismissed  the  applications  of 
Waseem  Sana  etc.,/respondents  vide  order  dated  28.06.2007  by 
maintaining the earlier order of approval/confirmation of the sale. 
For  ready  reference, relevant part  of the said order  is  reproduced 
as under:- 
22.  Vide  my  findings  in  issue  No.2,  the  auction  of  land  by 
the Liquidation Board has been conducted in quite transparent 
manners,  after  the  publication  in  the  prominent  newspapers 
of  the  country.  None  from  the  petitioners  turned  up  at  the 
occasion.  Their  plea  that  they  had  no  notice  of  the  auction, 
keeping  in  view  the  publication  twice  in  the  newspaper  as 
discussed  above,  is  devoid  of  any  force.  If  they  were 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016 
 
 
11 
interested they could have offered the price for the purchase 
of  land  collectively  or  otherwise  individually.  The  auction 
was  duly  scrutinized  by  the  NAB  Authorities  and  was 
approved  by 
the  Liquidation  Board  comprising  of 
responsible  officers  of  the  Provincial  Government.  So 
auction  in  question  was  conducted  in  quite  lawful  manner. 
Besides  other  reasons  one  of  the  reasons  to  maintain  the 
auction is,  that at  present  as many  as 103 allottees from  the 
Quaid  City  have  already  been  compensated  against  their 
claims.  This  is  also  a  fact  that  QCHP  is  subsidiary  of  the 
main  Cooperative  Society  i.e.  PDCCC  and  was  raised  with 
the funds of the members of the society. As such the transfer 
of  management  to  its  members  is  neither  practicable  under 
the law, nor is possible under the circumstances of the case. 
For  the  aforesaid  reasons  the  applications  of  the  petitioners 
merit dismissal and are dismissed accordingly.      
Against  the  said  order,  Petition  No.156-C  of  2007  was  filed  by 
Waseem  Sana  etc.,  and  the  Hon‟ble  Cooperative  Judge  set  aside 
the  auction  as  well  as  order  dated  28.06.2007  and  directed  the 
Board  to  prepare  the  scheme  for  securing  ends  of  justice  by 
looking after the interests of the allottees and also ensure that the 
land  be  utilized  for  the  same  purpose.  For  ready  reference, 
relevant portion of the said order is reproduced as under:- 
13.  As  a  result  of  the  above  discussion,  impugned  order 
dated  28.06.2007  is  hereby  set  aside  while  allowing  the 
application moved by the affectees/petitioners and the Board 
is directed to prepare the scheme for securing ends of justice 
by  looking  after  the  interests  of  the  allottees  and  to  ensure 
that  the  land  is  utilized  for  the  same  purpose.  The  allottees 
will  be  inducted  in  their  portions  of  land  and  development 
work will be made at the site after collecting money from the 
allottees  and  while  selling  the  assets  of  the  said  defunct 
society. The petitioners shall bear the expenses and also offer 
the Board for depositing the amount to  carry on the scheme 
for establishment of the said society.  
Firstly board was under obligation to develop the properties of the 
Co-operative  Society  by  formulating  a  development  scheme  with 
or  without  the  collaboration  of  the  officials  of  other  land 
development  agencies  and  after  accomplishment  of  the  object, 
adjust  the  members  according  to  their  entitlement  upon  the  plots

Writ Petition No.13686/2016 
 
 
12 
whereafter the left out assets/property was to be disposed of after 
assessing  the  market  value  but  the  Board  has  made  no  bonafide 
endeavor to formulate or execute any development scheme and in 
hasty  manner  proceeded  to  dispose  of  the  properties  owned  by 
individuals  of  the  public  without  following  the  relevant  law  and 
procedure  and  doled  the  property  at  previous  auction  price  in 
deliberate inter se collusion with the petitioners.  
 
8. 
The main controversy for adjudication and determination by 
this Court is as to whether the land of the society was auctioned as 
per  law.  In  this  regard  Order  21  Rule  66  CPC  furnished  ample 
guidance.  For  ready  reference,  Order  XXI  Rule  66  CPC  is 
reproduced as under:- 
66. Proclamation of sales by public auction.,--(1) Where any 
property is ordered to be sold by public auction in execution 
of  a  decree,  the  Court  shall  cause  a  proclamation  of  the 
intended sale to be made in  the language of such Court. 
(2)  Such  proclamation  shall  be  drawn  up  after  notice  to  the 
decree-holder  and  the  judgment-debtor  and  shall  state  the 
time and place of sale, and specify as fairly and accurately as 
possible:- 
a) the property to be sold; 
b) the revenue assessed upon the estate or part of the estate, 
where the property to be sold is an interest in an estate or in 
part of an estate paying revenue to the Government; 
c) any incumbrance to which the property is liable; 
d) the amount for the recovery  of which the sale is ordered; 
and 
e) every other thing which the Court considers material for a 
purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of 
the property. 
(3)  Every  application  for  an  order  for  sale  under  this  rule 
shall  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  signed  and  verified  in 
the  manner  hereinbefore  prescribed  for  the  signing  and

verification  of  pleadings  and  containing,  so  far  as  they  are 
known  to  or  can  be  ascertained  by  the  person  making  the 
verification,  the  matters  required  by  sub-rule  (2)  to  be 
specified in the proclamation. 
(4)  For  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  matters  to  be 
specified  in  the  proclamation,  the  Court  may  summon  any 
person  whom  it  thinks  necessary  to  summon  and  may 
examine him in respect to any such matters and require him 
to produce any document in his possession or power relating 
thereto.  
By conjunctive reading of Order 21 Rule 66 and Section 7 of the 
PCBL Act, 1993 it emerges out that the evaluation, assessment of 
price of the property under auction is mandatory  in nature and its 
conspicuous mentioning in the proclamation is also a fundamental 
requirement  of  the  law.  A  perusal  of  the  very  clipping  of 
proclamation  reveals  that  the  reserve  price  of  all  the  other 
properties  is  manifestly  described  therein  expect  the  land  in 
question  which  act  of  the  PCBL  rendered  the  entire  process  of 
auction  doubtful,  based  on  malafide,  fraud,  cartelization  and 
collusiveness.  The  Board  without  carrying  out  due  process, 
determination of market value of the land, obtaining a report about 
the  development  work  conducted  on  the  land  and  application  of 
judicial  mind  accepted  the  offer  even  without  determining  the 
amount of call deposit.  
9.  As  the  core  controversy  is  revolving  around  the 
legalities  of  the  auction  proceedings  it  would  be  quite 
appropriate  to  have  microscopic  examination  of  the  entire 
process  of  auction.    The  most  significant  document  in  this 
regard  is  the  very  advertisement  as  well  as  the  terms  and 
conditions of the auction. The terms and conditions written in 
the advertisement are as under:-

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  argued  that  the  provisions  of 
CPC are not applicable in the proceedings of the Board. Suffice it 
to say that admittedly no specific parameters/process is mentioned 
in the Act of 1993 for conduct of auction but undeniably the hall 
mark  principles  of  fairness,  transparency,  justness,  equity  and 
rationality  are  to  be  followed  and  the  provisions  of  CPC  are 
clearly  based  on  above  principles.  Further,  admittedly  any 
provision of the Act specifically does not exclude the adherence of 
the principles of CPC and every authority or tribunal has inherent 
jurisdiction to perform its function in transparent manner adopting 
the  principle  of  natural  justice  to  eradicate  the  element  of 
collusiveness  and  fraud  as  well  as  to  protect  the  rights  of  the 
parties. Moreover, Civil Procedure Code is a Comprehensive Law 
on  the  subject  and  its  provisions  are  made  applicable  to  all  the 
civil  proceedings  in  the  absence  of  any  such  provision  in  the 
statute  itself.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases  reported  as 
Muhammad Siddiq & Another Vs Zawar Hussain Abidi & Others 
(PLJ  1976  SC  493)  &  Syed  Anjum  Zafar  &  8  Others  Vs  Syed 
Abbas Ali Shah & 6 Others (2000 SCMR 59).

From  bare  perusal  of  the  publication,  it  is  revealed  that 
reserve  price  of  all  the  other  properties  has  expressly  been 
mentioned  but  surprisingly  the  reserve  price  of  the  land  in 
question  has  deliberately  neither  been  evaluated  nor  disclosed  in 
the  advertisement  and  this  material  deficiency  is  considered 
enough  to  undo  the  very  process  of  auction.  No  reason  has  been 
advanced for non-mentioning the reserve price which leads to the 
irresistible  conclusion  of  the  existence  of  collusivity,  unfair 
oblique aims of the auctioning agency as well as the petitioners, as 
such,  the  superstructure  built  on  the  said  publication/auction 
proceedings  will  have  to  fall.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  of 
Rehmatullah  &  Others  Vs.  Saleh  Khan  &  Others  (2007  SCMR 
729).  Moreover,  from  the  perusal  of  terms  and  conditions 
reproduced  above,  it  was  mandatory  for  the  purchaser  to  deposit 
the bank draft or pay order of the call deposit, according to reserve 
price  of  the  property  but  in  this  case  as  the  reserve  price  was 
missing,  on  what  basis  the  auction  purchaser  of  his  own  could 
make  assessment  of  the  price  of  the  property  in  order  to  deposit 
the  bank draft/amount  of  call  deposit. Moreover non-determining 
of  the  reserve  price  is  a  grave  illegality  which  undermined  the 
sanctity  of  the  conducted  auction  which  otherwise  was  based  on 
malafides  and  fraud.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  reported  as 
National Bank of Pakistan & 117 Others Vs SAF Textile Mills Ltd.

&  Another  (PLD  2014  SC  283).  For  ready  reference,  relevant 
portion is reproduced as under:- 
“As  a  supplement  to  the  aforesaid,  it  may  be  noted  that  no 
doubt,  some  rudimentary  procedure  for  conducting  such 
sales  is  provided  in  subsection(4)  of  section  15  of  the 
Ordinance of 2001 but yet again the time honoured and well 
entrenched  principle  of  fixation  of  a  “reserve  price”  is 
conspicuous  by  its  absence.  It  is  now  well  settled  law  that 
even  where  the  sale  is  conducted  by  the  Court  a  “reserve 
price” is essential and the absence thereof may be fatal.  
 
In  another  case  reported  as  Messrs  Lanvin  Traders,  Karachi  Vs 
Presiding  Officer,  Banking  Court  No.2, Karachi  &  Others  (2013 
SCMR 1419), it has been observed as under:-  
“Agreed  that  the  expression  “reserve  price”  does  not  find 
mention  in  the  relevant  rule  but  the  words  used  in  the  rule 
pointedly  hint  thereto.  A  sale,  in  its  absence,  is  apt  to  give 
walkover to  maneuverers to  fix any price of their choice. A 
sale thus effected is no sale in the eye of law especially when 
the  number  of  bidders  is  meager,  which,  indeed  is  close  to 
nill.  A  superstructure  of  sale  built  on  such  a  shaky 
infrastructure  cannot  sustain  itself.  Neither  the  buttress  of 
limitation nor the ministerial nature of the rule can prevent it 
from a fall”. 
“Crux  of  what  has  been  discussed  above  is  that  clever 
maneuvering  forcing  way  for  disposal  of  a  property  in 
execution  of  a  decree  for  a  paltry  sum  has  to  be  guarded 
against and jealously so with all the care and circumspection 
so  that  it  may  go  for  a  sum  it  deserves.  The  judgments 
rendered in case of “Messrs Majid and Sons and another -v. 
National  Bank  of  Pakistan  through  Manager  and  another” 
“Messrs  Magi  Chemicals  Industries  v.  Habib  Bank”  Appu 
alias  Subramania  Patter  v.  O.  Achuta  Menon  and  others” 
“Mir  Wali  Khan  and  another  v.  Manager  Agricultural 
Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  Muzaffargarh  and  another" 
(supra) may well be referred to in this behalf”.  
 
 
 
Reliance can also be placed on the case reported as Ahmed 
through LRs Vs Faysal Bank Limited & Others (PLD 2018 SC 
91).  
(The  Above  judgment  (M/s  Lanvin  Traders)  has  again  been 
approved  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  through  instant 
judgment.)

In  another  case  the  sale  made  through  auction  without  fixing  or 
mentioning  the  reserve  price  came  under  consideration  of  Sindh 
High  Court  reported  as  Messrs  NIB  Bank  Limited  Vs  Messrs 
Apollo  Textile  Mills  Limited  &  2  Others  (PLD  2013  Sindh  430) 
of which relevant portion is hereby reproduced as under:-  
 
 
“Intention of law was to fix reserve price in proclamation to 
safeguard  rights  of  judgment  debtor.  Court  auctioneer, 
without  any  authority,  rather  against  the  provision  of  Order 
XXI, Rule 85. C. P. C. fixed 30 days' time for the payment of 
the  balance  consideration,  which  otherwise  was  required  to 
be paid in terms of Order XXI, Rule 85, CPC within a period 
of  15  days.  No  reserve  price  of  the  property  was  settled. 
Where  the  property  was  sold  in  complete  disregard  of  rules 
and in questionable circumstances, even suo motu action for 
setting aside the sale would be justified  
"No  reserve  price  was  fixed  in  the  proclamation  by  the 
Executing Court,  auction proceedings were illegal  and were 
liable  to  be  set  aside.  Such  omission  had  rendered  the 
proclamation to be illegal”.  
"Under Rule 84 of Order XXI C. P.C., an auction purchaser 
shall  deposit  25%  of  the  auction  amount  immediately  on 
being  declared  as  highest  bidder.  While  the  requirement  of 
Rule  85  of  Order  XXI  that  full  amount  of  purchase  money 
must be paid by the purchaser within 15 days from the date 
of sale, is  mandatory. Non-payment  of the price  on the part 
of the defaulting purchaser renders the sale proceedings as a 
complete nullity. 
 
10.  Admittedly,  the  auction/bidding  process  took  place  on 
21.10.2003,  the  Board  approved  the  said  bid  on  30.10.2003  and 
approval  letter  was  issued  on  18.11.2003  whereafter  25% 
(Rs.31,806,000/-)  amount  was  required  to  be  deposited  within 
seven days till 25.11.2003 but the petitioners made deposit of the 
amount  of  Rs.26,789,700/-  on  21.10.2003,  whereas,  rest  of  the 
amount  was  deposited  on  04.12.2003  after  about  13  days  delay 
which  default  is  a  clear  violation  of  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
advertisement as well as of the law on the subject. The details of 
the amount deposited by the petitioners are as under:-

From the perusal of  aforementioned details of deposited amounts 
it is very much clear that the petitioners failed to make the deposit 
of the auction amount within the stipulated period as mentioned in 
the  advertisement  and  as  such  committed  further  a  deliberate 
default of even the terms and conditions of the bid. The Board was 
not  vested  with  any  authority  to  enlarge  the  stipulated  period  by 
itself  and  no  permission  was  ever  sought  or  granted  for  such 
delayed  deposit  under 
the  bid/auction.  Moreover,  any 
unauthorised  belated  deposits  if  so  made  cannot  remedy  the 
default  committed  by  the  auction  purchasers  and  provisions  for 
forfeiture  of  the  deposited  amount  could  have  been  invoked  as 
discussed  and  held  in  the  case  reported  as  Mst.  Nadia  Malik  Vs

Messrs  Makki  Chemical  Industries  Pvt.  Ltd.  through  Chief 
Executive  &  Others  (2011  SCMR  1675).  For  ready  reference, 
relevant portion is reproduced as under:- 
 
 
“...........Clause  4  of  the  proclamations  provides  that  the 
remaining  75%  of  the  auction  money  shall  be  deposited  in 
court within 15 days from the date of auction, failing which 
the executing court can forfeit the amount of auction money 
deposited on the conclusion of the auction. These conditions 
are  in  fact  borrowed  from  the  provisions  of  Order  XXI, 
Rules  84,  85  and  86,  CPC.  In  other  words,  the  executing 
court had chosen to  adopt  the procedure provided under the 
CPC for executing the decree. There is nothing on record to 
show that the decree-holder had ever approached the banking 
court to execute the decree in the manner other than the one 
provided  under  the  C.P.C.  Therefore.  the  argument  of  the 
learned  counsel  for the  appellant  on the issue of application 
of  the  provisions  of  C.P.C.  by  the  executing  court  are 
without substance.”  
“.........  ”Admittedly,  this  amount  was  not  deposited  by  the 
said date and record reveals that an application for extension 
of  time  was  made  by  the  appellant  on  13.05.2002  and  on 
14.05.2002 an amount of 3.00 million was deposited and for 
the balance amount of 3 million further time of 10 days was 
sought.  The  default  in  deposit  of  the  balance  amount  was 
violative  of  the  mandatory  conditions  provided  under  the 
proclamation  which  language  was  borrowed  from  the 
mandatory provisions of the Order XXI of the CPC. Failure 
to  deposit  the  balance  amount  of  75%  of  auction  money 
within  15  days  by  the  appellant  renders  the  sale/auction 
proceedings nullity. "  
“The  appellant  admittedly  has  violated  the  mandatory 
conditions  and  the  contention  of  the learned  counsel  for  the 
appellant  that  the  court  in  its  discretion  can  extend  time  to 
the  appellant  for  deposit  of  balance  amount  of  75%  of  the 
sale price after the lapse of 15 days by virtue of sub section 
(2) of section 19 of the Ordinance, does not appeal to reason. 
Afzal Masood Butt v. Banking Court No.2 Lahore and others 
reported as (PLD 2005  SC 470) wherein  this court has held 
that non-payment of 75% balance auction amount within 15 
days  in  violation  of  provisions  of  Order  XXI,  Rule  85, 
C.P.C. would render the sale nullity and the executing court 
is  bound  to  order  re-sale  of  the  property  in  terms  of  Order 
XXI, Rule 86, CPC. Moreover, the case of the respondents is 
supported by the judgments  of the  Indian Supreme Court in 
the  cases  reported  as  Manilal  Mohanlal  Shah  and  others  Vs 
Sardar Sayed Ahmad Sayed Mahmad and others  (AIR 1954 
SC  349)  and  Balram  son  of  Basha  Ram  v.  Ilam  Singh  and 
Others  (AIR  1996  SC  278),  wherein  it  has  been  held  that 
provisions  of  Order  XXI,  Rules  84,  85  and  86  CPC  are

mandatory in nature and violation of the same would render 
the sale nullity."  
 “In  the  face  of  the  afore-said  illegalities  coupled  with  the 
non-deposit  of  the  balance  sale  amount  of  75  %  within  5 
days  renders  the  sale  culminating  from  such  auction 
proceedings as nullity "  
 
 
11.  Now  adverting  to  the  mandatory  terms  and  conditions  of 
auction as settled and circulated in the advertisement wherein it is 
unambiguously mentioned that:-

The petitioners being fully cognizant of the above clear stipulation 
participated in auction  and being successful bidder were required 
to  deposit  25  %  within  clear  7  days  and  rest  of  the  amount  was 
liable to be deposited within 30 days from the date of issuance of 
letter of acceptance of auction but the petitioners failed to deposit 
the amount of 25% within seven days as well as rest of the amount 
75% within 30 days, as such, by operation of provisions of Order 
21  Rule  85  CPC  their  deposited  amount  should  have  been 
forfeited.  From  perusal  of  details  of  the  deposits  made  by  the 
petitioners,  it  is  quite  evident  that  deposits  were  made  after  the 
expiry  of  the  period  provided  in  the  advertisement  and  no 
convincing  explanation  has  been  furnished  in  this  regard  by  the 
petitioners‟ to dislodge the mandatory obligation as per the terms 
and  conditions  of  auction  whereas  the  Board  in  complete

21 
derogation  of  the  law  on  the  subject  and  with  shameless 
collusiveness  kept  the  auction  intact  rather  confirmed  the  same 
without  taking  into  consideration  the  default  of  the  bidder  which 
amounts  to  commission  of  fraud  with  the  public  property.  Such 
deliberate collusive auction garners no sanctity in the eyes of law. 
It  is  settled  law  that  every  state  functionary  while  dealing  with 
public property and determining the rights of the public must have 
to  show  ultimate  fidelity  in  the  interest  of  justice  as  well  as  the 
public  rights  and  is  under  extraordinary  obligation  to  maintain 
fairness,  equity,  impartiality  of  racial,  religious,  social  and 
financial  nature,  while  dealing  with  public  affairs  without  any 
element of bias, partiality and doubt as great expectation of public 
are attached with official proceedings and any deviation therefrom 
would render the auction proceeding as nullity in the eyes of law 
as  settled  in  the  cases  reported  as  Alleged  Corruption  in  Rental 
Power  Plants  etc.:  In  the  matter  of  Human  Rights  Cases  Nos. 
7734-G/2009,  1003-G/2010  and  56712  of  2010,  decided  on  30th 
March,  2012  (2012  SCMR  773).  For  ready  reference,  relevant 
portion is reproduced as under:- 
“Every  action  taken  by  the  Government  must  be  in  public 
interest and its action would be liable to be invalidated on the 
touchstone  of  reasonableness  and  public  interest  and  if  it 
fails  to  satisfy  either  test,  it  would  be  unconstitutional  and 
invalid: 
"The  law  is  well-settled  that  contracts  by  the  State,  its 
corporations, 
instrumentalities  and  agencies  must  be 
normally  granted  through  public  auction/public  tender  by 
inviting  tenders  eligible  persons  and  the  notification  of  the 
public-auction  or  inviting  tenders  should  be  advertised  in 
well  known  dailies  having  wide  circulation  in  the  locality

auction,  subject-matter  of  auction,  technical  specifications, 
estimated  cost,  earnest  money  Deposit,  etc.  the  award  of 
Government  contracts  through  public-auction/public  tender 
is  to  ensure  transparency  in  the  public  procurement,  to 
maximize

tenderers,  to  provide  for  fair  and  equitable  treatment  of  all 
tenderers,  and  to  eliminate  irregularities,  interference  and 
corrupt  practices  by  the  authorities  concerned.  This  is 
required by Article 14 of the Constitution. In our opinion this 
is an essential requirement in a democracy, where the people 
are  supreme,  and  all  official  acts  must  be  actuated  by  the 
public interest, and should inspire public confidence. "  
In  case  of  Ramona  Dayaram  Shetty  v.  The  International 
Airport  Authority  of  India  (AIR  1979  SC  1628).  the  Court 
has held as under:-  
......dealing with the public. whether by way of giving jobs or 
entering  into  contracts  or  issuing  quotas  or  licences  or 
granting  other  forms  of  largess,  the  Government  cannot  act 
arbitrarily  at  its  sweet  will  and,  its  action  must  be  in 
conformity  with  standard  or  norms  which  is  not  arbitrary 
irrational  or  irrelevant.  The  power  or  discretion  of  the 
Government in the matter of grant of largess including award 
of jobs, contracts, quotas, licences etc., must be confined and 
structured  by  rational,  relevant  and  non-discriminatory 
standard  or  norm  and  if  the  Government  departs  from 
standard or norm in any particular case or cases, the action of 
the Government would be liable to be struck down, unless it 
can be shown by the Government that the departure was not 
arbitrary,  but  was  based  on  some  valid  principle  which  in 
itself was not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory. "  
In  case  of  Ram  and  Shyam  Co.  v.  State  of  Haryana  (AIR 
1985  SC  1147),  the  Indian  Supreme  Court  has  held  as 
under:.  
“…….disposal of public property partakes the character of a 
trust  in  that  in  its  disposal  there  should  be  nothing  hunky 
panky and that it must be done at the best price so that larger 
revenue  coming  into  the  coffers  of  the  State  administration 
would  serve  public  purpose  viz.  the  welfare  State  may  be 
able to expand its beneficent activities by the availability of

available  price  while  disposing  of  public  properties.  They

Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  reported  as  Human  Rights  Cases 
Nos.4668  of  2006,  1111  of  2007  &  15283-G  of  2010  (PLD  2010  SC 
759) wherein the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:-  
"This  Court,  time  and  again,  has  insisted  upon  public 
functionaries to adhere to the principle of transparency in the 
performance  of  their  duties.  In  the  case  of  Messrs  Airport 
Support  Services  v.  The  Airport  Manager  (1998  SCMR 
2268),  this  Court  dealt  with  the  question  whether  a 
concluded  contract  could  be  struck  down  on  the  grounds  of 
mala fides arbitrary exercise of discretionary power, lack  of 
transparency,  discrimination  and  unfairness,  etc.  Relevant 
portion from the judgment is reproduced below:- (Emphasis 
is ours) 
“Further  a  contract,  carrying  elements  of  public  interest, 
concluded  by  functionaries  of  the  State,  has  to  be  just, 
proper, transparent, reasonable and free of any taint of mala 
fides,  all  such  aspects  remaining  open  for  judicial  review. 
The rule is founded on the premise that public functionaries, 
deriving  authority  from,  or  under  law,  are  obligated  to  act 
justly,  fairly  equitably,  reasonably  without  any  element  of 
discrimination  and  squarely  within  the  parameters  law,  as 
applicable  in  a  given  situation.  Deviation,  if  of  substance, 
can  be  corrected  through  appropriate  orders  under  Article 
199  of  the  Constitution.  In  such  behalf  even  where  a 
contract,  pure  and simple, is  involved, provided  always that 
public element presents itself and the dispute does not entail 
evidentiary  facts  of  a  disputed  nature,  redress  may  be 
provided”. 
In the case of Shams and Brothers v Government of Pakistan 
(2007  CLD  125)  a  Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court  of 
Sindh, Karachi while dealing with the issue of causing heavy 
financial  loss  to  the  exchequer  in  awarding  a  contract,  held 
as under"  
"23.  From  the  above  discussion,  we  have  come  to  an 
irresistible  conclusion  that  the  whole  process  of  inviting  of 
tender  sealed  offers  by  the  respondent  No  2  on  the  first 
occasion  as  well  as  on  the  second  occasion  was  game  of 
fraud and cheating full of ulterior name and mala fide, aimed 
to  oblige  some  particular  party  (respondent  No  4)  and  for 
causing  heavy  financial  loss  to  public  exchequer.  Thus,  we 
have no option but to allow and dispose of this petition in the 
terms  that  the  acceptance  of  the  bid  of  respondent  No.  4  in 
the  sum  605.000;  subsequent  awarding  of  contract  in  his 
favour  and  the  whole  process  of  bidding  conducted  by 
respondents Nos. 1 and 2 for this purpose is illegal, without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect. The respondent Nos. 
1 and 2 are, therefore, directed to invite fresh bids/offers for 
granting of lease of Pakistan Sports Board Coaching Centre 
plot  at  Sir  Shah  Suleman  Road.  Karachi  for  the  purpose  of 
marriage  lawn,  by  incorporation  of  only  such  conditions,

Reliance  can  also  be  placed  on  the  case  reported  as  Atta  Ullah  Khan 
Malik  Vs  Federation  of  Government  of  Pakistan  through  President  of 
Pakistan & 3 Others (PLD 2010 Lahore 605 (DB). For ready reference, 
relevant part is reproduced as under:-  
 
 
 
 
“Public  Property  held  by  public  authorities  is  held  in  trust. 
Public  functionaries  (civil  servants  or  officers  of  any  public 
authority) are the Trustees of the said property  on behalf of 
the  people  of  Pakistan.  No  public  officer,  how  high  up  he 
may  be  in  a  public  institution,  has  the  right,  authority  or 
power  to  sell,  leave  or  transfer  even  a  single  inch  of  public 
property  unless  it  is  strictly  in  accordance  with  law  and 
meets  the  public  standard  of  open  public  tender  and  open 
public  auction.  “The  government  in  itself  has  no  private” 
interest  of  its  own.  The  government  exists  for  the  sake  of 
individuals.  The  government  does  not  exist  for  its  “own‟

must  protect  and  safeguard  public  property  like  a  lioness

the public functionaries in the stewardship of this sacred trust

In  a  reported  case  titled  as  Muhammad  Qahir  Shah  &  Others Vs 
Federation  of  Pakistan,  Ministry of  Railways,  through  Secretary, 
Islamabad & Others (2014 YLR 2571 DB), the learned Division 
Bench held as under:-  
 
  
interest 
to  auction  purchasers---Loss 
to  public 
Undue  benefit 
exchequer  ---terms  of  Bid  not  abided  by---sale  not 
proclaimed/advertised  properly-Land  owned  by  government 
local government or public institutions was a valuable public 
asset and must be put to the best possible use for the benefit 
of  the  citizens-When  public  properties  were  sold  the  bid 
conditions must be complied with-Successful bidders did not 
abide  by  the  term  of  Bid  Documents,  and  the  Bid  Forms 
With  regard  to  the  most  important  aspect  i.e.  making 
payment as stipulated-Comparatively small percentage of the 
sale  consideration  had  been  paid  till  date;  five  years  had 
elapsed  since  the  bids  were  submitted-Price  of  property 
increased  over  a  period  of  time  whereas  the  effect  of 
inflation and other factors depreciated the value of money in 
Pakistan-Public 
therefore  had  been  seriously 
compromised  and 
the  auction  purchasers  had  been 
accommodated  and  extended  huge  benefit  at  the  cost  of  the 
public exchequer. 
Pakistan Railways in extending the time for making payment 
to  the  auction  purchasers,  without  publicly  informing  the 
general  public  that  it  had  changed  the  payment  terms  and 
without  inviting  fresh  bids  in  such  terms  acted  unfairly, 
unreasonably,  unjustly  and  illegally,  and  caused  prejudiced 
to  the  public  interest-failure  of  the  auction  purchasers  to 
make  payment  promptly  and  as  per  the  terms  of  the  bids 
documents and bids forms was a major contravention of the 
sale terms, which also adversely affected the public interest.  
In  the  case  of  Haji  T.M.Hassan  Vs  Kerala  Financial  Corpn. 
(AIR 1988 SC 57), the Court observed that:  
"It  is  needless    to  state  that  the  Government  or  public

available  price  while  disposing  of  public  properties.  They 
should  not  generally  enter  into  private  arrangements  for  the 
purpose.”  
The Hon‟ble Supreme Court stated that natural resources too 
came within the definition of „property‟ and belonged to the 
general  public  and  property  which  must  not  be 
compromised:--

From  the  perusal  of  the  advertisement  and  record  appended  with  this 
petition we are of the view that the initial step taken by the Board for the 
auction of the public property was not in accordance with law as reserve 
price  of  property  put  up  for  auction  was  not  fixed  in  derogation  of 
mandatory requirement under Order 21 Rule 66 CPC which flaw in itself 
was  not  curable  rather  proper  auction  proceedings  should  have  been 
conducted  after  evaluating  and  fixing  the  reserve  price  which  exercise 
admittedly  has  not  been  undertaken  by  the  respondent  Board  which

Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016 
 
 
27 
vitiated  the  sanctity  of  the  auction,  as  such,  when  the  initial  process  of 
proclamation  was  patently  illegal  then  all  subsequent  proceedings 
dependent 
thereupon  shall  automatically  collapse.  Further, 
the 
respondents  produced  so  many  criminal  complaints/FIRs  against  the 
then Chairman PCBL (Brig. Muhammad Farooq Maan) which shows the 
involvement  of  the  said  Chairman  in  multifarious  transactions  of 
corruption/corrupt  practices  and  misuse  of  authority.  In the  instant  case 
the  said  Chairman  admittedly  confirmed  the  auction  of  public  property 
in  interse  collusion  with  the  petitioners  at  a  throw  away  price  without 
following  the  prescribed  procedure,  transparency  and  also  trampled  the 
sacred vested right of the lawful owners/affectees in naked disregard to 
the  legitimate  expectations  of  the  state  as  well  as  public  attached  with 
the  state  functionaries,  who  are  under  legal  obligation  to  protect  the 
rights of the public in complete consonance of law. Reliance is placed on 
the  case  reported  as  Muhammad  Rafique  Bhatti  &  Others  Vs  The 
Cooperative Judge, Lahore High Court, Lahore & Others (2016 SCMR 
670). For ready reference, relevant portion is reproduced as under:- 
"By  this  order  the  Chairman,  PCB,  cancelled  the  "No 
Objection  Certificate  ("NOC")”  dated  30.10.1997  issued  by 
his  predecessor for sale to  the petitioners of land measuring 
193 Kanals, 12 Marlas situated in village Maraka, Tehsil and 
District Lahore belonging to National Industrial Cooperative 
Finance Corporation ("NICFC") in exchange for cash deposit 
receipts  (“CDRs”)  issued  by  the  NICFC  and  National 
Industrial  Cooperative  Credit  Corporation  (“NICCC”),  both

“The  petitioners  state  that  the  sale  consideration  under  the 
agreements  to  sell  exceeds  the  value  for  the  land  transacted 
and  the  cancellation  of  NOC  dated  30.10.1997  by  the 
Chairman,  PCBI  on  28.04.2001,  as  affirmed  by  the  High 
Court, violates the vested rights of the petitioners.

12.  So far as the  arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners 
that  except  the  petitioners  no  other  land  developer  came  forward  to 
participate and purchase the land, suffice it to say, that vide letter dated 
10.11.2003 appended at Page-3 in C.M.No.6995/2015 Defence Housing 
Authority  (DHA),  Islamabad  had  shown  its  explicit  willingness  to 
purchase  the  suit  land  at  higher  reasonable  rate  but  the  said  offer  was 
never  placed  before  the  Board  for  consideration  rather  the  Chairman 
himself malafidely closed the matter by writing a letter dated 20.11.2003 
intimating  DHA  that  the  property  has  already  been  auctioned  and  the 
Board  has  finally  approved  the  auction  on  30.10.2003,  as  such,  the 
Chairman by withholding the real facts with malafide intention managed 
the ouster of all other competitors from participating in arena of contest 
for  the  auction.  Moreover,  respondent  Waseem  Sana  alongwith  other 
members  of  the  society  also  made  a  clear  offer  to  pay  more  price  than 
the  auctioned  rate  but  unfortunately  their  request  was  also  disregarded 
by Chairman of the Board who adamantly doled out the public property 
to  his  favorite  one.  Besides  above,  it  is  unimaginable  and  illogical  that 
the  rate/price  of  the  property  in  the  year  1989  was  shown  as 
Rs.1,50,000/-  per  kanal  whereafter  substantial  infrastructure  such  as 
roads  were  constructed  by  spending  about  20  million  rupees,  how  the 
price  of  semi  developed  land  could  reduce  by  50%  in  the  year  2003 
whereas 
the  commercial  activities  and 
land  development  were 
flourishing  rapidly  in  the  area  which  aspect  also  presents  a  crude 
example of favouritism and nepotism etc., in this transaction. It is settled

law  that  public  property  cannot  be  disposed  of  through  private 
understanding.  Reliance 
is  placed 
in 
the  case 
titled  American 
International  School  System  Vs.  Mian  Muhammad  Ramzan  &  Others 
(2015  SCMR  1449).  Moreover  publication  dated  04.10.2003  itself 
shows  that  for  all  other  properties,  meant  for  auction,  their  value  was 
assessed and reserve price was fixed except the disputed land the detail 
whereof is as under:- 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
For  the  property  situated  within  the  District  Khushab  the 
reserve price was fixed Rs.3,75,000/- per kanal. 
For  the  property  situated  in  Muzaffargarh  the  reserve  price  was 
fixed one million. 
For  agricultural  land  situated  in  Daulu  Khurd  and  reserve  price 
was fixed Rs.1,50,000/- per Kanal. 
It  may  also  be  noted  that  in  the  advertisement,  the  reserve  price  of  the 
lands  situated  in  far  flung  areas  in  District  Khushab,  Muzaffargarh  and 
Daulu  Khurd  was  fixed  at  higher  rates  as  against  the  semi  developed 
property  situated  on  the  G.T.Road  Rewat,  Rawalpindi  closer  to  the 
metropolitan cities of Rawalpindi and Capital City of Islamabad, which 
was  sold  out  @  Rs.76,000/-  per  Kanal,  without  assessing  the  reserve 
price  to  the  petitioners  with  malafide  intention  thus  a  fraud  was 
committed in disposing of public property in the said transaction by the 
Chairman  who  confirmed  the  bid  at  a  throw  away  rate/price.  This 
conduct  in  itself  is  a  sound  evidence  of  the  collusiveness  and  undue 
favour  extended  by  the  then  Chairman  who  relentlessly  caused  huge 
damage  to  the  public  exchequer  while  disposing  off  public  property 
arbitrarily at ridiculously low throw away price which required initiation 
of criminal proceedings against him under the NAB Ordinance.

13.  Learned  counsels  for  the  petitioners  while  laying  much  emphasis 
that auction has been completed and it has attained the status of past and 
closed matter which could not be reversed after such a long time, placed 
reliance on case reported as Messrs Ashraf Agro & Others Vs HBL (2008 
CLD  449).  From  perusal  of  the  referred  case  it  is  evident  that  subject 
property  was  put  to auction  and five  attempts  of  auction  were  made  on 
different dates and judgment debtor moved an application for fixation of 
reserve  price  on  25.12.2003  which  was  dismissed  for  non-prosecution 
but judgment debtor never sought its restoration and auction proceedings 
remained pending from 1999 to June 2005, as such, the cited judgment is 
not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. In the 
case in hand admittedly reserve price was not fixed and DHA as well as 
the members of the society were making better offer to purchase the land 
but their requests were maliciously ignored and rejected, as such, above 
facts  exclude  applicability  of  the  judgment  cited  above.  Further,  the 
learned counsel for the petitioners heavily reiterated and relied upon case 
reported as Zakaria Ghani & 4 Others Vs Muhammad Ikhlaq Memon & 
8 Others (PLD 2016 SC 229) by arguing that non-fixing of reserve price 
is an immaterial irregularity which could not be made  basis to frustrate 
the  auction  proceedings.  Suffice  it  to  say  in  this  regard,  that  the  said 
judgment  of  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  has  been  revisited 
and is made distinguishable for multiple reasons and peculiar facts as the 
issue  qua  the  absence  of  Reserve  Price  has  been  considered  by  the 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recently pronounced judgment 
Writ Petition No.22158/2009 
Writ Petition No.13685/2016 
Writ Petition No.13686/2016

reported as Siraj Ahmed through LRs Vs Faysal Bank Limited & Others 
(PLD  2018  SC  91).,  wherein  it  has  been  once  again  held  that  the 
absence of Reserve Price is fatal for sale of property by auction.  
 
Thus,  the  reserve  price  in  the  normal  course  may  have  no  special 
significance under the principle of willing buyer and willing seller. However, 
the position would be different in case of auction of public assets by the state 
functionaries  or  by  the  representative  of  such  authority  which  requires 
extraordinary  transparency  and  circumspection  to  safeguard  the  vested  or 
accrued  rights  of  the  public  without  any  iota  of  mala  fide,  arbitrariness  and 
collusiveness  in  order  to  protect  and  preserve  the  sanctity  of  auction 
proceeding  in  the  eyes  of  law  but  the  afore-mentioned  traits  are  absolutely 
lacking in the auction proceedings conducted in the matter in hand as such the 
learned  Cooperative  Judge  has  rightly  passed  the  impugned  judgment  which 
does  not  suffer  from  any  infirmity,  illegality,  perversity  or  any  jurisdictional 
defect calling for interference through constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.  
14.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  writ  petition  is  dismissed. 
Judgment dated 10.07.2009 passed by the learned Cooperative Judge is 
hereby maintained.
