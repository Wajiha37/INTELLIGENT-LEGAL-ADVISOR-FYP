Writ Petitions No.37-R and 38-R of 2016 
2. 
Through  Writ  Petitions  No.37-R  and  38-R  of  2016,  the 
petitioner  (Province  of  Punjab)  has  challenged  the  validity  of  order 
 
W.P. No.37-R/2016 
W.P. No.38-R/2016

dated  16.11.2015  passed  by  the  Notified Officer /  Member  (Judicial-
III),  Board  of  Revenue  who  after  setting  aside  the  order  dated 
01.03.2003  passed  by  the  Secretary  (S&R)  restored  the  order  dated 
30.11.1976  passed  by  the  Settlement  Commissioner  (Lands),  Multan 
Division and order dated 12.03.1988 passed by the Additional Deputy 
Commissioner, (G) Lahore, Cantt., Lahore. 
3. 
Brief  facts  of the  case  are  that land  measuring  521-Kanals  19-
Marlas in Khata No.130, Village Charar, Tehsil & District Lahore was 
allegedly allotted to one Shujaat Ali S/o Himayat Ali. Against the said 
allotment,  Umrao  Bakht,  Ashraf  Ali  and  Anwar  Hussain  Ali  filed 
Mukhbari  Applications,  which  were  allowed  and  allotment  in  favour 
of Shujaat Ali was cancelled by the then Notified Officer, Multan vide 
order  dated  30.11.1976  and  said  land  was  allotted  to  the  Mukhbars 
and accordingly Robkar No.21381 was issued to the ADC (G) Lahore 
Cantt.,  for  implementation.  Ashraf  Hussain  etc.  (Mukhbars)  filed 
application  on  11.02.1991  for 
implementation  of  order  dated 
30.11.1976  as  well  as  decree  of  Civil  Court  dated  01.07.1990  and 
Robkar  dated  21.03.1988.  The  then  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner, 
Punjab  on  the  said  application  constituted  a  committee  vide  order 
dated 24.04.1991 to look into the instant case as well as other similar 
pending  matters.  The  committee  summoned  Mr.  Mumtaz  Jaoiya, 
former  ADC  (G),  Cantt.,  Lahore  and  recorded  his  statement  in 
connection with Robkar dated 21.03.1988 purportedly issued by him, 
who categorically denied the genuineness of the Robkar as well as his

W.P. No.80-R/2016

signature and stated that no Robkar was issued by him. The then Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner  in  the  light  of  the  available  evidence 
declared  the  Robkar  dated  21.03.1988  to  be  bogus,  fabricated  and 
non-existent  document  and  finally  vide  memo  dated  01.03.2003 
cancelled the said allotment of Umrao Bakhat, Ashraf Hussain, Anwar 
Hussain,  Balquees  Begum  and  Majida  Begum  as  the  same  was 
secured on the basis of forged and fabricated order dated 30.11.1976. 
Against  the  above  order,  Writ  Petition  Nos.36-R,  56-R  and  64-R  of 
2003 were filed, which petitions were accepted by the learned Single 
Judge  in  Chambers  vide  order  dated  19.12.2012  by  setting  aside  the 
impugned  order  dated  01.03.2003  and  the  case  was  remanded  to  the 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  to  hear  the  parties  and  decide  the 
matter  afresh.  Similarly  another  Writ  Petition  No.32500/2013  was 
also allowed by this Court on 16.12.2013 in view of the earlier order 
dated  19.12.2012  passed 
in  Writ  Petition  No.56-R/2003,  and 
remanded  the  matter  to  the  Notified  Officer,  Lahore  for  decision  on 
merits.  In  the  post  remand  proceedings,  the  Notified  Officer  vide 
order dated 16.11.2015 restored the order dated 30.11.1976 passed by 
Settlement  Commissioner  (Lands),  Multan  Division,  Multan  as  well 
as  order  /  Robkar  dated  12.03.1988  passed  by  Additional  Deputy 
Commissioner (General) Cantt., Lahore. Hence, these writ petitions. 
 
Writ Petition No.80-R of 2016 
4. 
Through  Writ  Petition  No.80-R  of  2016, 
the  petitioner 
challenged the order dated 16.11.2015 passed by the Notified Officer,

Lahore and also requested that direction may be issued to respondents 
No.1  to  3  to  transfer  the  property  in  possession  of  the  petitioners  as 
per law. 
5. 
Brief facts of this petition are that the petitioners are occupants 
of  constructed  house  bearing  Khasra  Nos.1196,  1197,  1198,  1199, 
1200,  1201,  1202,  1215,  1217,  1135,  1136,  1137/90-11,  1161/94-01 
and are entitled for allotment of the same as per judgment of Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case  of  Muhammad  Ramzan  and 
others  Vs.  Member  (Rev.)  /CSS  and  others  (1997  SCMR  1635) 
whereas  the  notified  officer  without  taking  into  account  the  actual 
physical  status  passed  the  order  dated  16.11.2015  and  allotted  the 
above  said  Khasra  to  the  respondent  which  allotment  is  not 
sustainable in the eyes of law.  
6.  M/s.  Hafiz  Muhammad  Yousaf  and  Muhammad  Shahzad 
Shaukat, Advocates appearing on behalf of the petitioners submit that 
the  order  dated  30.11.1976  passed  by 
the 
then  Settlement 
Commissioner  (Lands),  Multan  Division  is  without  jurisdiction  and 
without  lawful  authority;  that  the  said  Notified  Officer,  Multan  was 
not competent to allot the land situated in Lahore Cantt., which land is 
beyond  his  territorial  jurisdiction;  further  submits  that  Robkar  dated 
12.03.1988 issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (General), 
Cantt., Lahore for allotment of an alternate land is also illegal as there 
is no provision available in the evacuee laws for allotment of alternate

land;  that  all  the  available  evacuee  urban  land,  including  the  land 
which has not yet been confirmed to any person against units or claim 
or which may be available in future in all the Revenue Estates situated 
within  the  Urban  Limits  of  a  Municipal  Corporation,  Municipal 
Committee,  a  Notified  Area  Committee,  Town  Area  Committee, 
Small  Town  Committee,  a  Sanitary  Committee,  or  Cantonment 
throughout  the  Province  of  the  Punjab  are  declared  as  building  sites 
vide notification dated 16.05.1973 and thereafter such land cannot be 
allotted  by  any  Notified  Officer;  that  the  original  allottee  had  not 
challenged the cancellation of their allotment before any forum till to 
date; submitted that the Province of Punjab through Chief Settlement 
Commissioner  /  Member  (Residual  Properties),  Board  of  Revenue  is 
custodian of the evacuee properties and is legally competent to assail 
the  illegal  order  of  the  allotment  and  to  file  instant  writ  petition; 
further submits that doctrine of past and closed transaction only gives 
protection to those rights which were created under the law and if any 
right  is  constituted  against  the  law  then  principle  of  past  and  closed 
transaction would not be applicable rather such void and illegal orders 
can  be  ignored  in  its  entirety;  submitted  that  the  impugned  order 
passed by the Notified Officer is against the law and facts of the case 
as  well  as  against  the  parameters  of  the  Scheme  1977.  In  support  of 
his  arguments  Mr.  Shehzad  Shaukat,  Advocate  has  relied  upon 
Muhammad Ramzan and others Vs. Member (Rev.) / CSS and others

7. 
Learned  counsels  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  respondents 
submits  that  Province  of  Punjab  is  not  competent  to  file  instant  writ 
petition;  that  against  the  order  dated  30.11.1976,  a  Writ  Petition 
No.861-R/1979  was  filed  by  Mst.  Hamida  Begum  etc.  which  was 
dismissed  vide  order  dated  29.09.1986  and  said  order  was  never 
assailed  before  any  forum,  as  such,  order  dated  30.11.1976  has 
attained  finality  and  the  principle  of  doctrine  of  past  and  closed 
transaction  is  applicable  upon  the  case  of  the  petitioners;  further 
submitted  that  the  petitioners  of  Writ  Petition  No.80-R/2016  are 
illegal occupants, as such, they are not entitled for any relief.

10.  The  evacuee  land  measuring  521-Kanals  19-Marlas  of  village 
Charar Tehsil and District Lahore was allegedly allotted to Shujaat Ali 
S/o  Hamid  Ali.  Upon  the  Mukhbari  applications  of  Umrao  Bakht, 
Ashraf Ali and Anwar Hussain Ali / respondents, the allotment of said 
Shujaat  Ali  was  cancelled  and  said  resumed  land  was  allotted  to  the 
respondents  vide  order  dated  30.11.1976  by 
the  Settlement

Commissioner (Lands), Multan Division. Whereas as per notification 
reproduced  above,  only  the  Commissioner,  Lahore  Division  was 
competent  to  adjudicate  upon  the  matter  and 
the  Settlement 
Commissioner Multan was not competent to pass order of allotment in 
favour  of  Mukhbars,  as  such,  alleged  order  dated  30.11.1976  was 
passed without jurisdiction, which is illegal, coram non-judice and has 
been  passed  without 
lawful  authority.  From 
the  perusal  of 
aforementioned  notification  dated  14.11.1974  only,  the  Notified 
Officer  mentioned  in  column  No.1  of  the  said  Schedule  was 
competent  to  adjudicate  the  matter  falling  within  the  territorial 
jurisdiction  mentioned  in  column  No.3.  In  this  case,  the  Notified 
Officer  Multan  illegally  invoked  jurisdiction  of  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner, Punjab Lahore and without lawful authority passed the 
order  of  allotment  of  evacuee  land  falling  beyond  his  territorial 
jurisdiction,  whereas  the  respondents  failed  to  produce  any  order 
passed  by  competent  authority  in  respect  of  transfer  of  the  case  for 
adjudication from Lahore to Multan. Furthermore, as per notification 
reproduced  above,  the  Notified  Officer  of  Multan  Division  has  no 
power  to  allot  the  land  situated  within  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of 
Notified  Officer,  Lahore.  Moreover  in  the  presence  of  notification 
dated  16.05.1973  as  well  as  after  the  repeal  of  evacuee  laws  on 
01.07.1974,  the  Notified  Officer  Multan  was  not  competent  to  allot 
land situated within the Municipal Limits of Lahore Cantt., which has 
already declared as building site and said land can only be disposed of

by the competent authority under Scheme 1977 framed under Section 
3 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement ) Act, 1975.  
  
Admittedly, vide notification dated 16.05.1973, all the available 
urban agricultural land in district Lahore was declared as building site 
which  land  could  not  be  allotted  against  any  pending  evacuee  claim, 
since  the  issuance  of  the  above  notification  whereas  after  the 
Repealing Act 1975 there exists no agricultural urban land in Lahore 
for any allotment or adjustment against unsatisfied claims of produce 
index  units  and  the  claimants  holding  any  unsatisfied  entitlement 
pending PIUs may seek any other remedy if available under the law, 
whereas  they  stood  disentitled  to  obtain  allotment  of  urban  land  in 
satisfaction of pending units or get alternate allotment of land as held 
by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  reported  as 
Muhammad  Ramzan  and  others  Vs.  Member  (Rev.)  /CSS  and  others 
(1997 SCMR 1635):-  
“we  are  inclined  to  hold  that  on  the  promulgation  of  the 
“Notification”, dated 16th May, 1973 (supra) no agricultural urban 
land existed or was available for disposal. Moreover the date when 
the repealing Act became operative there was no land available for 
adjustment  against  produce  index  units.  Mere  fact  that  in  some 
matters  regarding  adjustment  of  specified  land  were  under 
consideration  or  had  not  been  carried  out  would  not  bring  the 
grievance within the purview of section 2(2) of Act XIV of 1975. 
Therefore, Notified Officer had no jurisdiction to allot, or transfer 
the land or grant alternate lands against unadjusted verified units.  
Further,  in  Notification  dated  16.05.1973,  the  competent  authority 
declared  the  evacuee  properties  as  “building  sites”  and  it  cannot  be 
allotted against rural claims rather it can only be disposed of under the 
Scheme  for  Management  and  Disposal  of  Available  Urban  Land,

1977, whereas informers (Mukhbars) right does not stand anywhere in 
the  said  Scheme,  as  such,  the  impugned  order  of  allotment  dated 
24.04.1991  passed  by  the  former  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  is 
also against the parameters laid down in the Scheme. Furthermore, the 
Notified  Officer,  Lahore  while  passing  the  impugned  order  dated 
16.11.2015 has  also not  considered propriety  or  impropriety  of  order 
of  the  Settlement  Commissioner  (Land)  Multan  Division  dated 
30.11.1976  which  order  was  rendered  blatantly  without  lawful 
jurisdiction  as  well  as  against  notification  dated  14.11.1974. 
Moreover,  the  then  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  vide  order  dated 
24.04.1991  constituted  a  probe  committee 
to 
investigate 
the 
genuineness  of  the  allotments  and  said  committee  summoned  Mr. 
Mumtaz  Joiya,  ADC(G)  Cantt.  who  allegedly  made  alternate 
allotment,  adjustment  and  issued  Robkar  dated  21.03.1988.  He 
appeared,  got  recorded  his  statement  before  the  committee  and 
categorically  denied  the  issuance  of  above  Robkar  as  well  as  denied 
his signature on the impugned Robkar whereas no document has been 
produced  in  rebuttal of  the  above  statement, as such,  alleged  Robkar 
purportedly  issued  by  ADC(G)  Cantt.,  Lahore  lost  its  sanctity  as  the 
same  was  a  bogus  document.  Further  for  the  sake  of  arguments, had 
the said document of Robkar been issued by the ADCG even then the 
same  would  have  no  validity  as  the  said  officer  did  not  hold  any 
authority  to  allot  alternate land  as he does  not  stand  anywhere in  the 
Scheme  1977.  Admittedly  the  land  of  Harbanspura  definitely  falls

within  the  ambit  of  the  Notification  dated  16.05.1973  whereby  the 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  has  already  declared  it  as  building 
site  which notification  was  upheld  by  the Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan  in  its  dictum  laid  down  in  Ramzan  as  well  as  Ali 
Muhammad‟s cases. Moreover, admittedly, the respondents are not in 
the possession of the suit land and bare perusal of Robkar shows that 
respondents  allegedly  surrendered  their  land  in  Mauza  Charar  and  in 
lieu  thereof  alternate  land  was  allotted  to  them  by  the  Addl.  Deputy 
Commissioner  (G)  Land  who  was  vested  with  no  authority  to 
visualize  mechanism  at  his  own  whims  and  caprice  and  passed  such 
an  arbitrary  and  fanciful  order.  Furthermore,  from  scanning  of 
impugned  Robkar,  it  is  clearly  mentioned  therein  that  the  proposed 
land has already been transferred / allotted to  some other persons, as 
such,  the  allotment  of  an  alternate  land  measuring  202-Kanals  01-
Marla falling Khasra No.1161/94-1, 1137/90-11, 1141/10-14, 1142/6-
15  to  the  legal  heirs  of  Shahzadi  Umrao  etc.  as  well  as  issuance  of 
Robkar was made in contravention of law as no provision is available 
in  the  Repealed  Act  for  making  the  alternate  allotment,  rather  it  was 
mandatory  for  the  field  staff  to  seek  fresh  order/instruction  from  the 
competent authority before allotment of alternate land or proposal for 
the allotment which is not available on the record as such the orders of 
alternate  allotment  made  by  the  ADC  (G)  is  coram  non  judice  and 
void ab initio. Even Chief Settlement Commissioner has no authority 
to make allotment of alternate land as discussed in the cases reported

as Muhammad Ramzan and others Vs. Member (Rev.) /CSS and others 
(1997  SCMR  1635)  and  Ali  Muhammad  through  Legal  Heirs  and 
others  Vs.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  and  others  (2001  SCMR 
1822),  Member  Board  of  Revenue/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner, 
Punjab, Lahore Vs. Abdul Majeed & Another (PLD 2015 SC 166).  
Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that against the order 
of  allotment  dated  30.11.1976  a  Writ  Petition  No.861-R/1979  was 
filed  which  was  dismissed  in  limine  on  29.09.1986  by  this  Court,  as 
such,  order  dated  30.11.1976  passed  by  Notified  Officer  attained 
finality  and  also  attained  the  status  of  past  and  closed  transaction, 
suffice  it  to  say  that  admittedly  the  original  order  of  allotment  was 
passed by the Notified Officer designated for Multan Region who was 
vested with no jurisdiction to decide the matter relating the territorial 
jurisdiction of Notified Officer Lahore and no order of any competent 
authority  has  been  placed  on  record  to  show  the  transfer  of  claim  as 
well  as  the  said  Mukhbari  applications  from    Lahore  to  Multan  for 
adjudication  whereas  subject  evacuee  land  undeniable  fall  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Notified  Officer  of  Lahore  and  mere  consent  or 
convenience of the litigating parties does not confer any jurisdiction to 
adjudicate a matter outside its jurisdiction  rather it is only the dictates 
of  codified  law  to  bestow  or  rescind  the  jurisdiction  of  a  forum. 
Moreover, connivances of the parties or the colourable pursuit of the 
adjudicator  does  not  enlarge  his  territorial  jurisdiction  at  his  whims 
and  caprice  and  any  such  order  passed  by  an  interested  authority  is

coram non-judice, void, tainted with grotesque motive which does not 
have  any  legal  protection  and  will  not  be  considered  as  past  and 
closed  transaction.  The  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  has 
elaborately  discussed  and  answered  the  matter  of  past  and  closed 
transaction it is recent  judgment  reported  as  Shahid Pervaiz Vs. Ejaz 
Ahmad  &  Others  (2017  SCMR  206)  declaring  that  “the  principle  of 
past  and  closed  transaction  would  apply  in  case  where  rights  were 
created under the valid law, even if such law was allowed to lapse or 
was removed from the statute book, however, an instrument that was 
still born or treated by  the  court  as non est  was barred  from  creating 
any vested rights, let alone being protected under the doctrine of past 
and  closed  transaction.  The  Courts  were  duty  bound  to  protect  the 
rights  and  interests  created  under  a  law  and  also  to  deny  the 
enjoyment of rights purported / created under an invalid law. Where a 
party claiming the protection of rights, that were created under a law, 
failed to pass the test of constitutionality, as determined by the court, 
it could not take the plea of past and closed transaction. Moreover, it 
is reiterated that order passed in Writ Petition No.861-R/1979 attained 
the status of past and closed matter, suffice it to say that from perusal 
of  said  order,  it  reveals  that  the  notification  of  building  site  dated 
16.05.1973 was neither in question nor debated by the parties nor  its 
effect  was  considered  by  this  Court,  as  such,  said  order  dated 
30.11.1976  is  required  to  be  ignored  as  settled  in  Ramzan  Case 
(supra) wherein it is held as under:-

 “Now  we  will  proceed  to  deal  with  other  aspect  regarding 
consequence of order passed by authority having no jurisdiction in 
the  matter.  Question  relating  to  legality  and  impact  of  void  order 
and for disregarding the same when nullity, has been considered by 
this  Court  on  numerous  occasions.  Pivotal  question  which  needs 
attention is whether impugned orders concerning allotment of land 
passed by Notified Officer are mala fide or suffer from total lack of 
jurisdiction  or  have  been  passed  in  disregard  to  existing  law  and 
tends to  frustrate provisions of evacuee laws and schemes framed 
thereunder, therefore, be deemed as nullity. In case of Muhammad 
Swaleh. (PLD 1964 SC 97) this Court ruled, that if circumstances 
disclose  that  order  pre-eminently  provides  right  to  either  party  is 
nullity  the  same  should  be  ignored.  In  the  case  of  Yousaf  Ali  v. 
Muhammad  Aslam  Zia  (PLD  1958  SC  104)  the  Court  did  not 
attach  finality  to  the  orders  which  were  passed  by  an  authority  in 
excess of its jurisdiction or suffered from want of jurisdiction and 
were  found  to  be  devoid  of  lawful  authority  and  nullity.  It  was 
observed  in  these  matters  that  edifice  constructed  on  the  basis  of 
void order crumbles alongwith same, and did not require to be set 
aside  through  appeals  or  any  other  proceedings.  In  the  case  of 
Mansab Ali v. Amir and 3 others (PLD 1971 SC 124)„it has been 
observed  that  "elementary  principles  of  law  require  mandatory 
condition regarding exercise of jurisdiction by a Court, Tribunal or 
Authority  must  be  fulfilled,  otherwise  all  proceedings  drawn  by 
such forum would suffers from total want of jurisdiction otherwise 
action  taken  and  decision  rendered  by  said  forum  shall  have  no 
legal effect. Similar view was taken m case of Major Syed Walayat 
Shah v. Muzaffar Khan and 2 others (PLD 1971 SC 184) wherein 
it was held that orders passed by tribunal having no jurisdiction are 
not  sustainable  and  all  successive  proceedings  based  upon  the 
same  are  equally  illegal  and  devoid  of  lawful  authority.  In 
Chittaranjan Cotton Mills Ltd.. v. Staff Union (PLD 1971 SC 197) 
it was observed that ”where the Court is  not  properly  constituted; 
all  the  proceedings  must  be  held  to  be  coram  non  judice  and, 
therefore,  non-existent  in  the  eye  of  law.  There  can  also  be  no 
doubt that in such circumstances it could never be too late to admit 
and  give  affect  to  the  plea  that  the  order  was  a  nullity”  and  thus 
impugned  order  was  set  aside.  The  above  discussed  proposition 
was  elaborately  discussed  in  case  of  Khuda  Bakhsh  v.  Khushi 
Muhammad  and  3  other  PLD  1976  SC  208)  wherein  action  and 
orders were found to be coram non  judice and nullity in the eye of 
law.  After  surveying  case-law  this  Court  in  a  recent  judgment 
reported  in  PLD  1997  SC  351  (Province  of  Punjab  through 
Secretary. Health Department v. Dr. S. Muhammad Zafar Bukhari) 
also dealt with the effect of orders which are void and coram non 
judice and propounded that same may not be carried out”.  
Even  in  another  case  reported  as  Ali  Muhammad  through  Legal  Heirs 
and  others  Vs.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  and  others  (2001  SCMR 
1822), the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared that if any 
concessional statement made by the state counsel during pendency of

W.P. No.38-R/2016 
W.P. No.80-R/2016 
 
 
16 
the petition either filed by the predecessor of the appellants or by the 
respondents would have no binding effect because such statement was 
not made in accordance with law. Similarly any observations made by 
learned High Court on such assurance if is found to be contrary to law 
the  same  will  be  deemed  to  be  coram  non  judice  having  no  legal 
effect. Relevant portion from supra dictum is reproduced as under:- 
“Thirdly in view of the concession made by learned State Counsel 
during pendency of the petitions either filed by the predecessor of 
the appellants or by the respondents would have no binding effect 
because such statement was not in accordance with law. Similarly 
any observations made by learned High Court on such assurance if 
is  found  to  be  contrary  to  law  will  be  deemed  to  be  coram  non 
judice as such shall have no legal effect.” 
Furthermore, the most emphasized assertion of the respondents 
is  that  their  unsatisfied  claim  was  pending  and  being  successful 
Mukhbars,  they  were  /  are  entitled  for  the  allotment  of  the  land  qua 
their  pending  claim  as  it  were  they  who  traced  out  the  illegal 
allotment, pursued the departmental proceedings get declared the said 
allotment  as  fraudulent  and  same  was  resumed  in  favour  of  the  state 
and a legally recognized right stood accrued in their favour, suffice it 
to  say  that  fraudulent  allotment  of  Shujaat  Ali  was  cancelled  on 
30.11.1976 much after the issuance of notification of the building site 
dated  16.05.1973  whereas  the  very  statute  on  the  subject  was  also 
stood  repealed  on  01.07.1974  introducing  significant  changes  in  the 
entire  process  excluding  the  fresh  allotment  as  well  as  allotment 
against Mukhbari claims leaving little possible scopes for any further 
allotment for satisfaction of any claim rather only active proceedings 
pending before Chief Settlement Commissioner, or the case remanded

from the Hon‟ble Supreme Court as well as by this Court can only be 
disposed of by the designated authority. For reference Section 2 (2) of 
the Act, 1975 is reproduced as under:- 
 “2.      Repeal  of  certain  laws.---(2)      Upon  the  repeal  of  the 
aforesaid  Acts  and  Regulations,  all  proceedings  which, 
immediately  before  such  repeal,  may  be  pending  before  the 
authorities  appointed  thereunder  shall  stand  transferred  for  final 
disposal  to  such  officers  as  may  be  notified  by  the  Provincial 
Government  in  the  official  Gazette  and  all  cases  decided  by  the 
Supreme Court or a High Court after such repeal which would have 
been remanded to any such authority in the absence of such repeal 
shall be remanded to the officers notified as aforesaid.” 
Whereas  this  arguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents  that 
Mukhbari  proceedings  were  initiated  much  before  the  repeal  of 
evacuee law, as such, the Notified Officer was well within jurisdiction 
to  make  allotment,  suffice  it  to  say  that  the  pending  proceedings 
means  only 
those  proceedings  which  were  actively  pending 
immediately  on  or  before  01.07.1974  or  the  cases  remanded  by  the 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court or High Court. The case of the respondents is 
not  covered  within  the  purview  of  pending  proceedings  as  no  claim, 
petition  or  proceedings  were  actively  pending  before  any  competent 
forum  which  brings  the  claim  of  the  Mukhbar  within  the  ambit  of 
pending proceedings.  The  Hon‟ble  Supreme  of  Pakistan  on  the  same 
proposition  has  laid  down  in  the  case  reported  as  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner  /  Member,  Board  of  Revenue  (S&R  Wing),  Punjab, 
Lahore Vs. Akhtar Munir & 6 Others (PLD 2003 SC 603) as under:- 
“The facts leading to the filing of Writ Petition No.52-R of 1984 
were that claim of the respondents were duly verified in District 
Rawalpindi  but  instead  of  getting  the  same  settled  in  District 
Rawalpindi the respondents sought their transfer to Lahore on the 
ground that they had shifted to Lahore. The verified claims were

Commissioner, Rawalpindi or Lahore in transit. The respondents 
have  not  cared  to  contest  the  appeal  and  it  appears  from  the 
record  that  they  had  for  the  first  time  moved  an  application  on 
26-2-1976  with  regard  to  the  whereabouts  of  their  claims  as  a 
result  of  which  a  duplicate  entitlement  certificate  was  issued  on 
22-11-1976. The case thus cannot be said to be actively pending 
consideration  before  the  authorities  concerned  for  final  disposal 
within the contemplation of the principle enunciated in Zafar Ali 
Khan  v.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  (1999  SCMR  1719). 
The  conceding  statement  of 
the 
department  can  have  no  bearing  on  the  case  in  view  of  the 
in  Muhammad  Ramzan  v.  Member 
observations  made 
(Revenue)/CSS 
that  disposal  of 
constitutional  petition  by  the  High  Court  based  on  illegal  and 
tainted concession of Settlement  Department  is  devoid  of lawful 
authority  and  subsequent  direction  for  its  implementation  is 
equally coram non judice and as such has no binding effect. The 
judgment dated 4-12-1991 vis-à-vis this petition thus suffers from 
a jurisdictional defect and there is force in the contention that it is 
void ab initio being coram non judice.” 
(1997  SCMR  1635) 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
Further, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has defined pending 
proceedings  in  a  case  reported  as  Government  of  Punjab,  Colonies 
Department,  Lahore  &  Others  Vs.  Muhammad  Yaqoob  (PLD  2002 
SC 5), as under:- 
“The  term  “pending  proceedings”  as  used  in  these  laws  would 
mean  that  an  initial  step  taken  as  contemplated  under  the 
settlement laws for allotment of land against verified claim of the 
claimants  but  the  same  did  not  finalize  before  the  repeal  of  the 
same,  therefore,  it  was  with  reference  to  such  cases  that  it  was 
provided that those would be taken forward and concluded under 
the repealed settlement laws as if they had not been repealed for 
the  said  limited  purpose  and  in  order  to  pass  final  order  in  such 
cases a provision was made to appoint a Notified Officer to deal 
with such cases. Mere possession of any evacuee land as claimed 
by the respondent in Chak No.223/RB in the writ petition would 
not  make  his  case,  a  case  of  pending  proceedings  within  the 
contemplation  of  provisions  of  sections  2  and  3  of  the  Evacuee 
Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975, 
therefore,  the  direction  issued  by  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High 
Court for allotment of the said land under the settlement laws to 
the  respondent  was  violative  of  law  which  could  not  have  been 
given,  for  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution, the  High  Court 
could direct a person performing functions in connection with the 
affairs of the Federal Government to do what law requires him to 
do  whereas  the  direction  issued  in  this  case  was  to  the  contrary 
i.e., what law did not require him to do, he was ordered to do.”

Furthermore, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in  another case 
reported  as  Nawabzada  Zafar  Ali  Khan  and  Others  Vs.  Chief 
Settlement Commissioner/Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore 
and Others (1999 SCMR 1719) decided that the matters which were 
either  actively  pending  consideration  before  the  Authorities  for  final 
disposal  or  has  been  remanded  by  the  High  Court  or  Supreme  Court 
were to be finalized by the “Notified Officers” and held as under:- 
“30.  Bare perusal of above provisions would disclose that only 
such  matters  which  were  either  actively  pending  consideration 
before Authorities for final disposal or had been remanded by the 
High  Court  or  Supreme  Court  were  to  be  finalized  by  the 
“Notified  Officer”.  The  Settlement  or  Rehabilitation  Authorities 
by express positive assertion have no jurisdiction to entertain any 
fresh  petition  or  representation.  In  the  present  case  undisputedly 
question of entitlement concerning agricultural property left over 
by  Nawab  Faiz  Ali  Khan  in  Patiala  State  was  neither  remanded 
by  this  Court  in  the  above  judgment,  dated  19th  July,  1962,  nor 
any  such  directions  were  made  by  the  High  Court  while 
dismissing the Petition No.121-R of 1989 on 11-2-1990, whereby 
notified  officer  on  its  strength  could  commence  proceedings. 
Therefore,  any  petition  or  representation  filed  by  the  petitioners 
with  regard  to  matter  which  otherwise  legitimate  claim,  same 
under  the  law  could  not  be  entertained  by  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner  or  Notified  Officer  or  any  other  Settlement 
Authority  by  virtue  of  „The  Repealing  Act‟.  Therefore, 
proceedings  drawn  by  Settlement  Commissioner  which 
culminated  in  passing  of  order,  dated  26-2-1992  were  devoid  of 
lawful  authority  and  deemed  to  have  no  legal  effect.  Therefore, 
on the established principle of law entire edifice constructed over 
it shall automatically crumble and fall to the ground.” 
Reliance  is  also  placed  on  the  case  reported  as  Ali  Muhammad 
through  LRs  &  Others  Vs.  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  &  Others 
(2001 SCMR 1822), wherein it has been held as under:- 
“41. 
In  view  of  the  aforesaid  discussion  we  are  persuaded  to 
hold  that  the  cases  of  the  private  parties  are  not  covered  by  the 
expression  “pending  proceedings”  in  terms  of  section  2(2)  of 
Evacuee  Property  and  Displaced  Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act, 
1975, therefore, they have no legitimate cause for transfer of the 
agricultural  land  situated  around  Faisalabad.  Moreover,  no  land 
was available for transfer being evacuee agricultural land in view 
of the Notifications, dated 3rd January, 1958 and 16th May, 1973

issued  by  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  respectively.  The 
Chief  Settlement  Commissioner/Notified  Authority  had  no 
jurisdiction/lawful  authority  to  make  the  allotments  in  favour  of 
private  parties  treating  their  cases  to  be  pending.  Similarly 
respondent  Muhammad  Waris  and  other  whose  case  was 
discussed at length was not entitled for transfer of the property in 
his  favour  because  admittedly  their  claim  was  allegedly  verified 
on  26th  January,  1991  much  after 
repeal  of  evacuee 
laws/regulations  by  Act  of  1975.  As  far  as  intervenors  are 
concerned they may approach the concerned department in view 
of the observations of the High Court in Civil Revision No.1062-
D of 1987, decided on 18-6-1990 and Writ Petitions Nos.2-R of 
1989 and others decided on 20th June, 1990 for redressal of their 
grievance. 
 
As a result of above conclusion Civil Appeals Nos.170 to 
176,  185  and  1561  to  1566  of  1999  are  dismissed  with  costs. 
Whereas Civil Appeals Nos.177 to 184 of 1999 are allowed with 
costs,  as  a  consequence  whereof  the  impugned  orders  operating 
against the appellants passed by High Court and Chief Settlement 
Commissioner/Notified  Authority  are  declared  as  of  no  legal 
effect.” 
Even otherwise, the Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court of  Pakistan  in the  latest 
judgment  reported  as  Member  Board  of  Revenue/Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner,  Punjab,  Lahore  Vs.  Abdul  Majeed  &  Another  (PLD 
2015  SC  166)  has  conclusively  held  that  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner /  Notified  Officer is not  competent  to  make  any  fresh 
or  alternate  allotment  of  land  to  any  person  in  lieu  of  any  belated 
claim. Relevant portion of said judgment is reproduced as under:- 
“15.  The Repealing Act, 1975 does not vest the Notified Officer 
with any authority to make a fresh allotment of available (evacuee) 
land. This disability includes the power to allot alternate land. The 
said limitations on the powers of the Notified Officer are discussed 
in  Saifullah  v.  Board  of  Revenue  (1991  SCMR  1255).  In 
Muhammad Ramzan v. Member (Rev.)/CS (1997 SCMR 1635), as 
follows:-- 
“(8)  With  the  repeal  of  the  Evacuee  Laws  in 
1975,  the  unallotted  agricultural  land  vested  in  the 
Provincial  Government  against  price  paid  for  it. 
Thereafter,  its  disposal  had  to  take  place  according 
to  the  Scheme  to  be  framed  by  the  Provincial 
Government. The Scheme framed by the Provincial 
Government made no provision for allotments to be 
made  against  the  pending  verified  produce  index 
units. For this reason the allotment made after 1975

W.P. No.80-R/2016 
 
 
21 
in  favour  of  the  persons  from  whom  the  appellant 
was  claiming  was  wholly  without  jurisdiction  and 
lacking  in  authority.  Notwithstanding  that  it  was 
made  on  the  direction  of  the  Board  of  Revenue,  it 
could  not  be  recognized  in  law  nor  could  it  be 
allowed  to  stand  on  record.  It  was  void  ab  initio. 
Consequently,  its  removal  even  by  an  illegal  order 
would  not  suffer  from  any  infirmity  but  would 
rather re-establish the legal and the correct status of 
the property. On this view of the matter the decree 
of the Civil Court could also not remain intact.”    
Furthermore,  the  evacuee  laws  were  repealed  on  01.07.1974  and  the 
Notified Officer was not competent to allot the land which has already 
been  declared  building  site  vide  notification  dated  16.05.1973.  The 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  reported  as  Muhammad 
Ramzan  and  others  Vs.  Member  (Rev.)  /CSS  and  others  (1997  SCMR 
1635)  has  observed  that  under  Notification  dated  16.05.1973,  the 
competent  authority  declared  the  evacuee  properties  as  “building 
sites” and it cannot be allotted against rural claims and it can only be 
disposed  of  under  the  Scheme  for  Management  and  Disposal  of 
Available  Urban  Land,  1977.  Further,  after  declaring  all  unsatisfied 
agricultural  urban  land  in  entire  Punjab  as  building  site,  vide  notification 
dated 16.05.1973 issued by the then Chief Settlement Commissioner which 
was  declared  valid  in  Muhammad  Ramzan  Case  (supra)  by  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  and  the  informants  (Mukhbars)  are  not 
considered  eligible  for  getting  any  allotment.  It  was  further  held  in  the 
aforesaid judgment as under:- 
“20.  With  this  background  we  proceed  to  examine  broad  aspects 
directly affecting validity of allotment orders passed by the Notified 
Officer,  which  are  subject-matter  of  scrutiny  in  these  appeals.  The 
Notification No.1697-73/1567-R(L) dated 16.05.1973 issued by the 
Chief  Settlement  and  Rehabilitation  Commissioner,  Punjab  has 
unambiguously  declared  “available  evacuee  urban  land”  including 
the one not  yet confirmed to any person against units, as “building 
sites” for disposal under section 13 of the Displaced Persons (Land

Settlement)  Act,1958.  Bare  reading  of  this  notification  clearly 
displays  that  same  was  executory  in  nature  and  became  operative 
immediately  on  its  issuance.  This  had  the  effect  of  converting 
unutilized  agricultural  urban  land  in  entire  Punjab  to  be  “building 
site”.  Validity  of  said  notification  and  competency  of  authority 
issuing  it  came  for  consideration  before  this  Court  in  several 
matters.  In  the  case  of  Bashir  Ahmed  and  others  v.  Punjab 
University  Academic  Staff  Association  and  others  (1991  SCMR 
377) it was held that allotment to informants concerning land which 
had  been  declared  as  a  “building  site”  could  not  be  made  after 
issuance of notification dated 16.05.1973. The relevant observations 
are reproduced below:- 
“The  order  dated  25.03.1974  passed  in  favour  of  the 
predecessor-in-interest  of  the  petitioners  was  challenged 
through  Writ  Petition  No.402-R  of  1976  by  the  Punjab 
University  Academic  Staff  Association  and  the  University 
of the Punjab whereby the informants were allotted the land 
becoming available by the setting aside of the allotments to 
Badar-ul-Hassan  and  Qureshi  Mahmud  Ahmad  on 
10.4.1974 as the land had in the meanwhile been sold to the 
University  Authorities  on  29.3.1974  under  section  10(2)  of 
the  Displaced  Persons  (Land  Settlement)  Act,  1958.  It  was 
alleged 
the  Additional  Settlement  Commissioner 
(respondent  No.2)  was  incompetent  in  law  to  make  the 
allotment to the informants as the land in question had been 
declared  as  a  building  site  by  the  Notification,  dated  16th 
May, 1973. This writ petition was allowed by the impugned 
judgment  of  the  High  Court  dated  6.4.1988.  Hence  this 
petition for leave. 
that 
Mr.  Shahzad  Jehangir  has  been  heard  on  behalf  of  the 
petitioners, who has submitted that the decision of the High 
Court  is  wrong.  But  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  High 
Court was right in holding that in the face of the Notification 
dated  16.5.1973  declaring  the  urban  lands  within  the 
Municipal limits etc. as „building sites‟ no allotment of such 
lands  on  the  basis  of  the  claimants  units,  whether  urban  or 
rural, could be made”.  
11.  So far as the arguments of learned counsel for the respondents 
that  the  Province  of  Punjab  is  not  competent  to  file  writ  petition 
against the order passed by the Notified Officer, suffice it to say that 
province  as  well  as  its  designated  officers  are  trustees  of  the  public 
assets  of  the  province  and  if  feels  aggrieved  of  any  order  passed  by 
any  public  functionary  in  violation  of  law  or  disloyalty  to  his 
obligation  or  under  the  taint  of  colourable  exercise  of  jurisdiction,  or

under  grotesque  intention  of  extending  favouritism,  nepotism  or 
unavoidable  political  pressure  /  motivation,  the  Government  of  the 
Province as well as its legally designated officer is well within right to 
challenge  the  such  fanciful  order  to  get  the  illegality  corrected  or 
reversed  as  held  in  Ali  Muhammad‟s  case,  wherein  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan resolved this controversy in a case wherein 
the order of the Notified Officer of Multan Division was challenged in 
a writ petition by Member (Residual Properties) / Custodian of Estate 
Land  on  behalf  of  the  Provincial  Government  and  same  was  held  as 
competent. Relevant portion of Ali Muhammad case is reproduced as 
under:- 
“In  this  behalf  it  is  to  be  noted  that  on  21-12-1992  order  was 
passed  by  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  Punjab  in  purported 
exercise  of  jurisdiction  of  Notified  Officer  under  section  2(2)  of 
Act of 1975 whereas the writ petition was filed by Member being 
the  Provincial 
custodian  of 
Government  because  after  3rd  January,  1958 
the  evacuee 
agricultural  land  subject-matter  of  the  proceedings  was  no  more 
evacuee  land  as  it  has  fallen  within  the  exclusive  ownership  of 
Member Board of Revenue Punjab.” 
the  State  Land  on  behalf  of 
As  such,  the  contention  of  the  respondent  regarding  the  non-
maintainability of the writ petition are totally misconceived and same 
are  hereby  repelled  as  such  the  Province  of  Punjab  through  Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner 
/  Member 
(Residual  Properties) 
is 
competent  being  highest  provincial  administrator  /  custodian  of  the 
state  evacuee  lands  in  the  province  to  challenge  the  illegal  order  of 
any Notified Officer(s):

12.  So  far  as  the  petitioners  of  Writ  Petition  No.80-R/2016  is 
concerned who claims to be illegal occupants over property measuring 
06-Kanals  including  Khasra  No.1137  and  1161  and  they  are  entitled 
to purchase the said property under Scheme 1977 made under Section 
3  of  the  Repealing  Act,  1975  suffice  it  to  say  in  this  regard  that  the 
legislature in Section 3 of the Evacuee Property & Displaced Persons 
Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  1975  introduced  that  the  Provincial  Government 
in  consultation  with  the  Federal  Government  should  make  a  Scheme 
for  Disposal  of  Urban  as  well  as  Rural  Properties  and  to  secure  the 
rights  of  the  evacuee/migrants  framed  Scheme  for  Management  and 
Disposal  of  Available  Urban  Properties  situated  in  the  Province  of 
Punjab, 1977 wherein the definition of building site has been defined 
in para 1(d) and the definition of possession is mentioned in para 1(i) 
of the Scheme, 1977 which are as under:- 
1. 
In this scheme, unless the context otherwise requires:-- 
(d) 
“Building Site” means any vacant plot of land which is not 
within  a  well  defined  compound  of  a  permanent  building  and 
includes:-- 
A  site  on  which  the  permanent  construction,  if  any,  does 
(i) 
not exceed in area by 1/8th of the site; 
(ii)  any  site  on  which  any  building  existed  but  was  completely 
demolished by floods, fire, incendiary or by any natural calamity. 
(i) 
“Possession”  means  possession  obtained  on  or  before  the 
first  day  of  January,  1976  by  any  person  and  includes  his 
successors-in-interest and assignee; 
And  under  the  above  policy  only  those  persons  who  were  in 
possession  of  the  evacuee  properties  on  or  before  the  Ist  day  of 
January 1976 are considered eligible under para 6 of Scheme, 1977 to

W.P. No.38-R/2016 
W.P. No.80-R/2016

apply for the purchase of evacuee land, house, shop, building sites but 
the petitioners have neither asserted in the petition to be in possession 
of the land before the fixed date nor appended any such document to 
prove that they fulfill the criteria as prescribed under the said Scheme 
of  1977  rather  they  themselves  admitted  that  they  are  the  illegal 
occupants/encroachers  and  it  can  conveniently  be  observed  that  they 
have  approached  the  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  with 
badly  soiled  hands.  This  Court  is  well  within  jurisdiction  to  decline 
the  grant  of  discretionary  relief  and  if  so  granted  that  would  be 
tantamount to awarding protection to the possession of the usurper of 
the state property as the illegal encroachers who have no protection of 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
It is settled principle of law that he who seeks equity must do equity, 
whereas  an  illegal  occupant  is  not  entitled  to  have  any  discretionary 
relief. The law leans towards those persons who believe in the rule of 
law  and  not  those  who  took  the  law  in  their  hands,  whereas,  the 
encroachers/illegal  occupants  have  no  right  as  held  by  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  Civil  Petition  No.882-L  of  2015  vide 
order dated 15.03.2017 as under:- 
“2.  We  find  that  in  the  light  of  above  circumstances,  the 
learned  High  Court  rightly  allowed  the  writ  petition  of  the 
respondents  and  restored  possession  of  the  property  to  them,  and 
correctly dismissed the writ petition of the instant petitioners, who 
are  admitted  encroachers  of  the  property  and  are  in  unauthorized 
possession therefore. Resultantly, this petition is dismissed.” 
As  the  petitioners  have  not  come  to  this  Court  with  clean  hands  and 
being  illegal  occupants  they  are  not  eligible  to  get  shelter  of  the 
 
W.P. No.37-R/2016 
W.P. No.38-R/2016 
W.P. No.80-R/2016 
 
 
26 
scheme  made  for  the  effectees  /  exodus  whereas  unauthorized 
occupants being not aggrieved persons are precluded to seek any relief 
through  extraordinary  constitutional  jurisdiction  as  they  come  to  the 
Court with soil hands. 
 
Furthermore,  a  decent  and  elaborate  modus  operandi  has  been 
laid down for the disposal of such evacuee lands in a recent judgment 
reported  as  American  International  School  System  Vs.  Mian 
Muhammad  Ramzan  &  Others  (2015  SCMR  1449)  by  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan wherein it is held that under Paragraphs 1 
(d),  11,  12  and  30  of  the  Scheme  for  Management  and  Disposal  of 
Available  Urban  Properties, 1977, the  evacuee  urban properties  shall 
be disposed of through unrestricted public auction and a similar view 
has been enumerated in C.P. No.709-L/2009 titled Member (Judicial-
V),  Board  of  Revenue/Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab  &  2 
Others Vs. Sagheer Muhammad Khan & Others wherein the Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  vide  order  dated  02.01.2015  settled  that 
after  the  Repeal  Act,  the  property  shall  be  disposed  of  through  open 
auction, the relevant portion thereof is reproduced as under:- 
“7. 
Considering  the  above,  we  are  clear  firstly  that  the 
conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Bench in para 9 of the 
impugned  judgment,  as  reproduced  above  is  incorrect  and  the 
reliance  on  the  case  of  Muhammad  Hussain  (supra)  is  also 
misplaced.  Secondly,  it  is  evident  that  as  of  date,  the  respondents 
can  have  no  claim  on  the  property  in  question.  According  to  the 
current  law  and  arrangements  put  in  place  by  the  Province 
subsequent to the Repeal Act the property will have to be disposed 
of  through  open  public  auction  so  that  the  assets  vested  in  the 
Province  and  ultimately  in  the  people  of  the  Province  are  duly 
protected.  This  shall  not  prevent  the  Province  from  proceeding 
against 
recovery  of 
compensation  for  occupation  and  use  of  the  property  and  for  any 
respondents  or  others  both 
the

other action civil or criminal in this case. This petition is converted 
into appeal and is allowed in the above terms.” 
13.  As  discussed  above,  the  orders  passed  by  the  Notified  Officer 
as  well  as  the  ADC  Cantt.  Lahore  have  no  consonance  with  the  law 
and policy on the subject as well as the dicta laid down by the Apex 
Court,  as  such,  the  same  are  liable  to  be  set  aside.  Resultantly,  Writ 
Petitions No.37-R and 38-R of 2016 are allowed and impugned orders 
are  hereby  set  aside  being  coram  non-judice  as  well  as  illegal  to  the 
extent of allotment of land to the Mukhbars and alternate allotment or 
adjustment made by ADC(G) whereas Writ Petition No.80-R/2016 is 
partially  dismissed  to  the  extent  of  allotment  of  evacuee  land  to  the 
petitioners.
