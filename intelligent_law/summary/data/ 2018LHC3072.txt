AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through  this  writ  petition 
following prayer has been made:- 
“It  is,  therefore,  most  respectfully  prayed  that  the  writ 
petition may kindly be accepted and impugned order dated 
17.05.2011  passed  learned  District  Judge,  Khushab  may

learned Civil Judge, Khushab may kindly be upheld in the 
supreme interest of justice.  
It is further prayed till the final decision of the writ 
petition  the  operation  of  the  impugned  order  dated

I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at 
length and also gone through the record.  
W.P.No.15389 of 2011.

3. 
 
Learned counsel for the respondent has raised three 
objections. One is that all the parties before the learned trial court 
have  not  been  made  party  in  the  instant  writ  petition,  as  such, 
writ  petition  is  defective  one. Second  is  that  Order  VII  Rule  11 
of  the  CPC  is  not  applicable  for  rejection  of  application  u/s  12 
(2) of the CPC and lastly, against a remand order writ petition is 
not competent.  
4. 
 
The  respondent  Mst.  Saban  filed  an  application  u/s 
12  (2)  of  the  CPC  on  30.11.2009  to  challenge  the  judgment  & 
decree  dated  13.02.1989  passed  by  Syed  Tahir  Hussain  Kazmi 
learned Civil Judge Khushab, on the basis of grounds mentioned 
in  the  application  u/s  12  (2)  of  the  CPC.  The  petitioners  Rab 
Nawaz etc (respondents No.1 to 7 of application u/s 12 (2) of the 
CPC)  moved  an  application 
for  summary 
rejection  of 
application,  which  was  rejected  vide  order  dated  24.11.2010. 
Mst. Saban preferred a revision petition, which was accepted by 
the learned District Judge, Khushab vide order dated 17.05.2011 
observing that Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC is not applicable to 
an application u/s 12 (2) of the CPC. Hence, this writ petition by 
Rab Nawaz etc.  
5. 
 
Needless  to  state  that  when  the  parties  to  a  lis  i.e. 
parties  to  the  application  u/s  12  (2)  of  the  CPC  have  not  been 
impleaded  and  necessary  parties  have  been  left  without  any 
justifiable  reasons,  therefore,  writ  petition  is  not  competent. 
Further  against  a  remand  order  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable 
W.P.No.15389 of 2011.

as it is a settled law enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan as well as this Court and other High Courts that it would 
not  be  appropriate  to  exercise  jurisdiction  under  Article  199  of 
the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  to 
interfere  with  a  remand  order  as  a  writ  lies  against  the  final 
adjudication and the remand order does not finally decide the lis, 
rather  the  Court  decided  the  case  earlier  has  to  re-decide  it. 
Reliance can be placed upon the judgments reported as “AKBAR 
Ali  and  18  others  versus  MUKHTAR  AHMAD  and  14  others” 
(2007  CLC  768),  “Mst.  SALIM-UN-NISA  and  5  other  versus 
AZIZ and another” (2009 CLC 860) and “MUHAMMAD ILYAS 
KHAN versus MUHAMMAD and others” (1986 S C M R 251). 
Furthermore, Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC is also not available 
for rejection of application u/s 12 (2) of the CPC. In this regard, 
light can be taken from the judgment of august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan  reported  as  “MRS.  ANIS  HAIDER  AND  OTHERS 
versus  S.  AMIR  HAIDER  AND  OTHERS”  (NLR  2008  Civil 
514). I would like to quote relevant paragraph as under:- 
“The very terminology used in order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. is 
indicative of the fact that it pertains to suits and plaints in 
particular.  The  Court  should  have  realized  the  difference 
between  a  regular  suit  and  an  application.  Section  141, 
C.P.C.  cannot  be  attracted  as  it  pertains  to  the  ordinary 
procedure laid down in Civil Procedure Code that may be 
followed  in  deciding  an  application  but  a  substantial 
requirement  of  recording of  evidence  on pure  and  serious 
question  of  fact  could  not  be  by-passed  by  unjustifiably 
W.P.No.15389 of 2011.

invoking of Order VII, rule 11, C.P.C. It appears that even 
the  implication  of  Order  VII,  rule  11,  C.P.C.  were  not 
properly  appreciated  and  applied.  The  order  can  be 
attracted only when a plaint by itself does not disclose any 
cause  of  action.  It  cannot  be  rejected  on  the  basis  of 
written statement because the initial burden remains on the 
plaintiff/petitioner  to  prove  his  case  on  the  basis  of 
assertions  made  in  the  pleadings.  If  the  principle  in  hand 
adopted by  the  Courts  below  is  endorsed, it  would be the 
easiest thing to dismiss any civil suit simply and merely on 
the basis of written statement.” 
 
 
6. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant writ petition is 
not competent, same stands dismissed.
