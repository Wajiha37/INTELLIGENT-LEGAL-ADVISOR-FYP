interest  of  respondents  No.3  to  10,  being  migratee  from  Mauza 
Kundhwala, Amar  Kot, Tehsil  Fazilka, District  Ferozepur,  India 
submitted his claim for allotment of land against that abandoned 
by  him  in  India.  Upon  verification  of  his  claim  against  the 
abandoned  land  in  India,  603  Produce  Index  Units  (PIUs)  were 
transferred to District Rahim Yar Khan for allotment in the year 
1972.  Against  the  said  PIUs,  land  measuring  31  Kanals  15 
Marlas  situated  in  Mauza  Taranda  Siway  Khan,  District  Rahim 
Yar Khan was proposed for allotment through RL-II No.591. The 
said allotment was confirmed by the competent authority through 
order,  dated  18.6.1973,    however,    the  same  could  not  be 
implemented in the revenue record due to the fact that the land in 
question  was  situated  within  the  territorial  limits  of  Municipal 
Committee  Rahim  Yar  Khan.  During  the  interregnum  period 
Ghulam  Abbas  died.    After  death  of  Ghulam  Abbas,  his  legal 
heirs  (respondents  No. No.3, 9 &  10)  filed  declaratory  suit  with 
the averments that after deposit of requisite fees in pursuance to 
the  allotment  order,  they  became  full  owner  of  the  land  in 
question. The said suit was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil 
Judge,  Rahim  Yar  Khan  vide  judgement  and  decree  dated 
26.11.1987. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the 
learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Rahim  Yar  Khan,  respondents  3,9 
and 10 filed an appeal which was accepted by the District Judge, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--3-- 
Rahim Yar Khan through judgment and decree, dated 30.7.1989. 
Further,  respondents  No.3,  9  and  10  also  filed  a  miscellaneous 
application for modification of the decree passed by the appellate 
court which was allowed by the appellate  court vide order dated 
8.3.1990.  Against  various  decisions  rendered  by  the  appellate 
court,  the  aggrieved  parties  filed  three  Civil  Revision  Petitions 
(Nos.415-D/1989,  415-D/1990  and  197-D/1991)  before  this 
court.  The  said  revision  petitions  were  allowed  by  this  court 
through  consolidated  judgment  and  decree,  dated  26.9.1993. 
While accepting the revision petitions, this court held that claim 
of  Ghulam  Abbas  for  allotment  of  land  would  be  deemed  to  be 
pending.  Being  swayed  with  the  observation  of  this  court,  legal 
heirs  of  Ghulam  Abbas  filed  application  before  the  Board  of 
Revenue,  Punjab,  Lahore  for  allotment  of  land  against  their 
pending  units.  As  said  application  remained  unattended,  legal 
heirs of Ghulam Abbas filed W.P.No.3715/1996/BWP before this 
court which was disposed of through order, dated 20.10.1996, in 
view of the statement of the learned Assistant Advocate General 
that  matter  would  be  decided  in  terms  of  judgment,  dated 
26.9.1993, passed in Civil Revision No.415-D/1989 within three 
months.  Resultantly,  the  matter  was  referred  to  the  Assistant 
Commissioner,  Rahimyar  Khan/Notified  Officer/Deputy 
Settlement  Commissioner 
(respondent  No.2)  who,  upon 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--4-- 
fulfillment  of  codal  formalities  allotted  land  measuring  224-
kanals  situated  in  Mauza  Bandur,  Tehsil  and  District  Rahimyar 
Khan  in  favour  of  legal  heirs  of  late  Ghulam  Abbas  vide  order, 
dated 28.04.2001, which was incorporated in the revenue record 
through Mutation  No.5730 attested  on 19.10.2001.  Later on,  the 
said  land  was  purchased  by  Abdul  Shakoor  (petitioner  in  the 
instant petition) by virtue of Mutation No.5739 dated 25.10.2001.  
3. 
On the other hand, one Rehmat Ali, predecessor-of-interest 
of  petitioners  in  the  connected  petition,  being  migratee  from 
Salamat Pura, Tehsil Paluth, District Jalandhar, India, filed Claim 
No.132320  for  allotment  of  land  against  his  land  abandoned  in 
India. After verification of his claim, initially he was allotted land 
measuring 169-Kanals & 12-Marlas in Mauza Bandur, Tehsil and 
District Rahim Yar Khan against R.L-II No.828/78 in lieu of 457 
PIUs  leaving  56  PIUs  unsatisfied.  As  Khata  No.41,  wherein 
Rehmat Ali was allotted land, was jointly owned by the Muslims 
and non-Muslims owners, the allotment made in his favour could 
not  be  effectuated  in  the  revenue  record.  As  a  result,  he, 
alongwith  others,  filed  Writ  Petition  No.1283/1963  before  the 
erstwhile  High  Court  of  West  Pakistan,  Lahore  but  without  any 
success  as  the  same  was  dismissed  through  judgment,  dated 
31.03.1966.  Aggrieved  by  the  judgment  passed  by  the  erstwhile 
High  Court  of  West  Pakistan,  Lahore,  Rehmat  Ali,  alongwith 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--5-- 
others,  agitated  the  matter  before  the  apex  court  of  the  country. 
The  august  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  decided  the  matter 
through  judgment  reported  as  Rehmat  Ali  and  others  v.  The 
Settlement  and  Rehabilitation  Commissioner,  Bahawalpur 
Division, Bahawalpur and others (1973 SCMR 356). Thereafter, 
land measuring 161 Kanals 12 Marlas situated in Mauza Bandur 
Tehsil  &  District  Rahim  Yar  Khan  was  allotted  in  favour  of 
Rehmat  Ali  in lieu  of  457  units  whereas  his  claim  for  allotment 
of 
land  against  56  pending  PIUs 
remained  undecided. 
Resultantly,  Rehmat  Ali  filed  application,  dated  13.06.1973, 
before  the  District  Collector/Rehabilitation  Officer,  Rahimyar 
Khan which was followed by a reminder, dated 20.11.1973. After 
death  of  Rehmat  Ali  in  the  year  1995,  his  inheritance  devolved 
upon his legal heirs (petitioners in the connected petition). As the 
application  filed  by  Rehmat  Ali  in  the  year  1973  was  not  being 
decided  by  the  relevant  authority,  his  legal  heirs  (petitioners  in 
the connected petition) filed W.P.No.3632/2000 before this court 
which  was  disposed  of  through  order,  dated  11.08.2000,  with  a 
direction to  the  Notified  Officer  to decide  the  matter  within  one 
month.  As  the  grievance  of  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  was  not 
redressed  despite  passing  of  order,  dated  11.08.2000,  by  this 
Court  they  were  constrained  to  file  another  Writ  Petition 
(No.335/2001)  for  allotment  of  land  against  their  pending  units, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--6-- 
however,  they  opted  to  withdraw  it  on  03.07.2001  with  the 
contention that the Notified Officer assured them for redressal of 
their grievance. Since the grievance of the legal heirs of Rehmat 
Ali  was  not  attended  to  by  the  authority  concerned,  they  were 
compelled to file another W.P.No.3082/2002 which they opted to 
withdraw  on  28.02.2012  with  permission  to  agitate  their 
grievance  before  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab. 
After withdrawal of aforesaid writ petition, they filed application 
before 
the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab 
for 
cancellation  of  the  land  allotted  in  favour  of  legal  heirs  of 
Ghulam  Abbas  and  its  allotment  in  their  name  in  lieu  of  their 
pending  PIUs.  The  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab, 
through order, dated 11.02.2015, while turning down the request 
of  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  for  allotment  of  land  against  their 
pending units, cancelled the land allotted in favour of legal heirs 
of Ghulam Abbas in the year 2001. Aggrieved by the cancellation 
of the land from the name of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas, Abdul 
Shakoor  has  filed  the  instant  petition  whereas  the  legal  heirs  of 
Rehmat  Ali  being  aggrieved  of  non-allotment  of  land  in  their 
favour in lieu of pending units have filed the connected petition. 
4.  Mr.  Bashir  Hussain  Khalid,  Advocate  representing  the 
petitioner in the instant petition & respondents No.5 to 13 in the 
connected  petition  submits  that  the  impugned  order  is  not 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--7-- 
sustainable for the reason that after decision regarding allotment 
of  a  specific  land  by  the  Notified  Officer,  the  same  is  not 
appealable/reviewable  before  any  other  authority  working  under 
the  settlement  laws  but  in  the  matter  of  the  petitioner,  the  land 
allotted  in  the  names  of  legal  heirs  of  Ghulam  Abbas  has  been 
cancelled  by  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab  while 
exercising his powers of review on the application submitted by 
the  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  (petitioners  in  the  connected  writ 
petition);    that  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  has  no  power  to 
review  an  order  passed  by  the  Notified  Officer;  that  the  apex 
court  of  the  country  during  the  course  of  hearing  of  C.P. 
No.1644-L/2011  observed  that  Notified  Officer    shall  not 
exercise  suo  moto 
jurisdiction  upon  any  miscellaneous 
application  which  does  not  fall  within  the  categories  of  cases 
specified in the Repeal Act, 1975; that after repeal of Settlement 
Laws  in  the  year  1975  the  landmark  judgment  was  rendered  by 
the apex court of the country in the case reported as Nawab Din 
v.  Member,  Board  of  Revenue  (Settlement  &  Rehabilitation) 
Punjab, Lahore and 4 others (PLD 1979 SC 846) which till date 
holds  the  field  and  according  to  the  ratio-decidendi  of  the  said 
judgment  the  proceedings  pending  regarding  verification  of 
claims  of  refugees  cannot  be  equated  with 
the  pending 
proceedings for allotment of land on the basis of verified claims; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--8-- 
that power of review of Chief Settlement Commissioner to annul 
an allotment on the ground that the claimant being not a refugee 
his claim was bogus, is always there but the said power cannot be 
exercised to undo a valid allotment made on the basis of verified 
claim. 
5.  Mr.  Naseeer  Ahmad  Chaudhry,  Advocate  appearing  on 
behalf  of  petitioner  in  the  instant  petition  and  proforma 
respondents No.5 to 13 in the connected petition, while adopting 
the  arguments  advanced  by  Ch.  Bashir  Hussain  Khalid, 
Advocate,  additionally  submits  that  as  this  court  while  deciding 
CR. No.415-D/1989 declared that claim of Ghulam Abbas would 
be  deemed  to  be  pending,  no  illegality  was  committed  by  the 
Notified Officer while  making allotment in favour of legal heirs 
of Ghulam Abbas.  
6. 
Learned  Law  Officer,  assisted  by 
learned  counsel 
representing  the  Settlement  department,  while  opposing  the 
instant  petition,  states  that  this  court  while  deciding  above 
referred Civil Revision Petitions held that R.L-II No.6799 issued 
in  the  name  of  Ghulam  Abbas  was  not  genuine,  thus,  no  land 
could be allotted in favour of Ghulam Abbas or his legal heirs in 
presence  of  such  findings;  that  this  court,  while  accepting  the 
above  noted  revision  petitions,  reversed  the  findings  of  the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--9-- 
appellate  court,  as  a  result  those  of  the  civil  court  were  upheld 
meaning  thereby  that  allotment  of  land  in  favour  of  Ghulam 
Abbas in Mauza  Taranda  Siway  Khan  was  held illegal, thus, no 
land could be allotted to him in future in lieu of the said land; that 
it  was  established  on  record  that  out  of  the  land  allotted  to 
Ghulam  Abbas,  major  chunk  was  earmarked  for  construction  of 
an  International  Hotel  but  the  said  fact  escaped  notice  of  the 
Notified Officer; that the Chief Settlement Commissioner has not 
annulled the allotment in favour of Ghulam Abbas merely on the 
ground that the land fell within the limits of municipal committee 
but also it was found that claim of Ghulam Abbas was referred to 
Dera  Ismael  Khan,  thus,  the  same  could  not  be  satisfied  in 
District Rahimyar Khan without proper transfer by the competent 
authority; that a person who seeks equitable relief is supposed to 
come to court with clean hands; that plea of bona fide purchaser 
is  not  attracted  against  the  land  allotted  under  settlement  laws; 
that at the most petitioner can sue against his vendors for making 
his loss good; that report of Patwari that the land in question does 
not fall within territorial limits of municipal committee cannot be 
given  precedence  over  the  findings  of  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner;  that  the  controversy  involved  in  the  present 
petition  cannot  be  decided  without  recording  of  evidence  which 
exercise cannot be undertaken in these proceedings. In support of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--10-- 
his  contentions,  learned  Law  Officer  has  produced  copies  of 
Notification  bearing  No.  LGA/526/3447-50,  dated  10.03.1986, 
regarding the local limits of the Municipal Committee Rahim Yar 
Khan,  Site  Plan  of  the  Municipal  Committee,  letter  dated 
01.09.2012  addressed  by  the  District  Collector,  Rahimyar  Khan 
to  the  Assistant  Commissioner  Rahimyar  Khan  and  others, 
Notification  bearing  No.200-2012/107-C.V.T 
(III),  dated 
25.08.2012,  issued  by  Board  of  Revenue  Punjab,  copy  of  letter 
addressed by the Additional District Collector, Rahimyar Khan to 
All 
the  Assistant  Commissioners  of 
the  district,  dated 
20.05.2015, Notification bearing No.141-215/64-CVT (III), dated 
20.05.2015, issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab. 
7.  Mian  Ahmad  Nadeem  Arshad,  Advocate  appearing  on 
behalf of respondents 3 to 10 in the instant petition has supported 
the stance taken by Ch. Bashir Hussain Khalid, Advocate. 
8. 
Ch. Bashir Hussain Khalid, Advocate for the petitioners in 
the instant petition, while exercising his right of rebuttal, submits 
that  the  learned  Law  Officer  as  well  as  learned  counsel 
representing Settlement department has tried to mingle up certain 
facts    just  to  mislead  this  court  which  is  not  acceptable;  that  as 
findings  of  this  court  whereby  revisions  petitions  field  by  the 
Municipal  Committee  were  accepted  and  it  was  declared  that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--11-- 
claim  of  Ghulam  Abbas  would  be  deemed  to  be  pending,  were 
not  challenged  by  the  Settlement  department  it  acquiesced  with 
the  same,  thus,  at  this  stage,  it  cannot  introduce  new  plea  while 
taking U-turn; that though certain portion of land of a Tehsil can 
be  considered  as  Urban  but  the  entire  Tehsil  cannot  be  consider 
so;  that  there  is  no  factual  inquiry  as  contented  by  the  learned 
Law Officer rather the matter can conveniently be decided by this 
court  on  the  basis  of  available  material;  that  the  petitioner  has 
already asserted in ground (vii) of the instant petition that if it is 
established on record that at the relevant time the land allotted to 
Ghulam  Abbas  fell  within  the  municipal  limits  of  Rahim  Yar 
Khan,  the  petitioner  would  have  no  case;  that  the  petitioner  is 
ready to bear the expenses  for appointment of local commission 
to verify said fact and that mala fide on the part of the legal heirs 
of  Rehmat  Ali  is  manifest  from  the  fact  that  while  filing 
application  before  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner,  Punjab 
they did not array the petitioner as party despite knowing the fact 
that his name was incorporated in the revenue record in the year 
2001.   
9.  Mr.  Mukhtar  Ahmad  Tahir  Kamboh,  representing  the 
petitioners  in  connected  petition  states  that  he  would  not  press 
said  petition 
to 
the  extent  of  respondents  No.5 
to  13. 
Consequently, the connected petition is dismissed as not pressed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--12-- 
to  the  extent  of  said  respondents  only.  To  the  extent  of  rest  of 
respondents  learned  counsel  submits  that  as  the  application  was 
filed by Rehmat Ali (predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners) on 
13.06.1973, followed by a reminder, dated 20.11.1973, their case 
fell within the category of pending proceedings; that the findings 
of respondent No.1 that case of the petitioner did not fall within 
category of pending proceedings stands nullified from the record; 
that  Notification,  dated  16.05.1973,  only  put  a  clog  against 
allotment  of  land  which  had  already  been  declared  as  building 
site whereas the petitioners claimed allotment of agricultural land 
against  their  pending  units;  that  the  case-law  referred  in  the 
impugned  order  is  not  applicable  to  the  case  of  the  petitioner.

and others (1973 SCMR 356) 
10.  Learned  Law  Officer,  assisted  by 
learned  counsel 
appearing  on  behalf  of  Settlement  department,  submits  that 
connected petition is not maintainable as three earlier petitions on 
the  same  subject  have  already  decided  by  this  court;  that  the 
application  submitted  by  Rehmat  Ali  (predecessor-in-interest  of 
the  petitioners)  in  the  year  1973  was  dismissed  by  the  Notified 
Officer, on 10.06.2001, in presence of the petitioners but the said 
fact has been concealed by them while filing connected petition, 
thus, they are not entitled to equitable relief; that mala-fide on the 
part of the petitioners is also manifest from the fact that through 
they  also  filed  proceedings  before  the  District  Collector,  Rahim 
Yar Khan but the said fact has also not been incorporated in the 
connected petition; that the order passed  by the  Notified Officer 
was not challengeable before any authority established under the 
settlement laws rather the same could only be assailed before this 
court  in  writ  petition  but  till  date  the  petitioners  have  not 
challenged orders dated 10.06.2001 and 19.07.2002 passed by the 
Notified  Officer  and  District  Collector,  Rahim  Yar  Khan 
respectively thus the connected petition merits dismissal.

--14-- 
11.  Ch. Bashir  Hussain Khalid, Advocate for  the  petitioner in 
the instant petition in furtherance of his above arguments submits 
that  the  learned  Law  Officer  as  well  as  the  learned  counsel 
representing 
the  Settlement  Department  have 
adopted 
inconsistent pleas inasmuch while defending the order impugned 
in  instant  petition  they  have  argued  that  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner,  Punjab  rightly  reviewed  the  allotment  made  in 
favour of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas, however, while opposing 
the  connected  petition  they  have  adopted  the  plea  that  order 
passed  by  the  Notified  Officer  is  not  challengeable/reviewable 
before  any  authority  working  under  the  Settlement  Laws  rather 
the  aggrieved  parties  are  supposed  to  approach  this  court  in 
respect of their grievance against the order passed by the Notified 
Officer. 
12. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable 
length and have also gone through the documents, annexed with 
these petitions as well as the case-law cited at the bar. 
13.  During  the  course  of  arguments,  Mr.  Mukhtar  Ahmed 
Tahir  Kamboh,  Advocate  for  the  petitioners  in  the  connected 
petition clarified that he has instructions not to press the petition 
to  the  extent  of  respondents  No.5  to  13  meaning  thereby  that 
private  parties  have  no  rival  claim  against  each  other  rather  the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--15-- 
petitioners  in  both  these  petitions  are  confining  their  prayer  for 
setting  aside  of  the  impugned  order  passed  by  the  Chief 
Settlement Commissioner, Punjab. 
14.  Now  reverting to the  merits of the  case, I  have noted  that 
Learned  Law  Officer,  assisted  by 
the 
learned  counsel 
representing  the  Settlement  Department,  ferociously  argued  that 
since the claim of Ghulam Abbas was declared as bogus by this 
court in its judgment, dated 26.9.1993, no land could be allotted 
to  him  or  his  legal  heirs  as  their  case  did  not  fall  within  the 
definition  of  pending  proceedings.  To  appreciate  the  said 
contention, I have gone through the entire judgment  rendered by 
this  court  in  above  referred  Civil  Revision  Petitions.  While 
dealing with the validity of allotment of land in favour of Ghulam 
Abbas this court has inter-alia observed as follows: - 
to 
the 
this  principle 
“7.  Applying 
facts  and 
circumstances  of  the  case  it  is  eminently  clear  that  the 
allotment made by the Settlement Authorities to Ghulam 
Abbas was merely paper transaction and, therefore, it did 
not  create  any  right  in  his  favour.  The  land  was  in 
possession  of  the  Province  of  Punjab  and  it  was  being 
used  for  public  purposes.  It  was,  therefore,  not  in  the 
compensation  pool  and  was  inacapable  of  allotment  to 
Ghulam  Abbas.  This  being  the  legal  position,  I  have  no 
difficulty in  coming to the conclusion that allotment, even 
if  made,  in  favour  of  Ghulam  Abbas  was  wholly  coram-
non-judice  and  was  of  no  lawful  consequences.  This  well 
established  principle  of  law  was  wholly  over-looked  and 
disregarded by the learned District Judge while rendering 
the  decision  dated  26.11.1987.  It,  therefore,  suffers  from 
patent error of law which is evident on the face of record. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--16-- 
The  decision  of  the  learned  District  Judge,  therefore,  is 
without any legal support and cannot be sustained. As the 
first  decision  falls  down,  the  subsequent  decision  also 
crumbles  as  being  super-structure  on  a  void  decision.” 
(emphasis provided) 
Further,  this  Court  while  dealing  with  the  sanctity  of  R.L-II 
No.6799 has inter-alia observed as under: - 
“There  is  yet  another  aspect  of  the  case.  A  bare  look  on 
RL-II  No.6799  indicates  peculiar  features  which  casts 
serious  doubt  about  the  genuineness  of  RL-II  No.6799. 
There  is  a  note  on  it  by  the  Patwari  which  indicates  that 
suit  land  was  proposed  to  one  Noor  Smand  vide  a  RL-II 
No.590; that this proposal was not confirmed as the same 
was  cancelled  from  one  Sadar-ud-Din  who  had  filed 
constitution petition in the High Court and had obtained a 
stay order.  This is  not the  end of it………..……This  being 
the  legal  position,  the  orders  of  the  Deputy  Settlement 
Commissioner  dated  30.4.1973  and  18.6.1973  are  wholly 
destitute of any legal foundation……” 
A  perusal  of  the  afore-quoted  paragraphs  shows  that  the 
allotment  of  land  subject  matter  of  the  Civil  Revisions,  referred 
Supra,  was  declared  illegal  mainly  for  two  reasons  viz.  firstly  it 
was  occupied  by 
the  provincial  government  by  raising 
construction  at  the  site,  thus,  same  was  not  available  in 
compensation  pool  and  secondly  the  said  land  was  already 
proposed  for  allotment  in  favour  of  one  Noor  Samand  but 
nowhere  in  the  entire  judgment  this  Court  declared  the  claim  of 
Ghulam Abbas as bogus. 
15. 
It is imperative to note that this Court in Para No.10 of its 
judgment, dated 26.09.1993, has inter-alia observed as under: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--17-- 
“10.  While  parting  with  this  order,  it  is  made  clear  that 
the  claim  of  Ghulam  Abbas  shall  be  deemed  pending 
within the terms of the Evacuee Properties and Displaced 
Persons  Laws  (Repeal)  Act,  (XIV  of  1975)  and  shall  not 
preclude  the  competent  authorities  from  allotting  any 
evacuee agricultural land which might be still available.” 
A cursory glance over the afore-quoted paragraph affirms that the 
claim of Ghulam Abbas was held genuine. Further, the competent 
authority was permitted to allot land against the claim of Ghulam 
Abbas,  thus,  no  illegality  was  committed  by  respondent  No.2. 
Moreover,  in  his  order,  dated  28.04.2001,  respondent  No.1  has 
referred  to  certain  communications  issued  by  various  authorities 
and after confirmation that claim of Ghulam Abbas to the extent 
of 603 PIUs was pending, he allotted the disputed land in favour 
of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas. 
16. 
It  is  notable  that  the  Assistant  Commissioner/Notified 
Officer/Deputy  Settlement  Commissioner,  while  deciding  the 
matter  vide  order,  dated  28.04.2001,  inter-alia  observed  as

According  to  the  order  impugned  in  these  petitions  the  Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner  observed  that  he  had  gone  through 
record  of  the  case  prior  to  passing  the  same  but  as  the  said 
important  fact  escaped  notice  of  respondent  No.1,  it  cannot  be 
believed  that  he  decided  the  matter  in  its  true  perspective. 
Further, if the allotment made by respondent No.2 was validated 
by the Chief Settlement Commissioner, the same could not be re-
opened on a miscellaneous application of other persons who were 
clamoring  for  allotment  of  land  against  their  pending  units  but 
the said important fact also went unnoticed.

Department is that as the unsatisfied units of Ghulam Abbas were 
transferred  to  Dera  Ismael  Khan  the  same  could not be satisfied 
in  district  Rahimyar  Khan  without  their  proper  transfer  by  the 
competent  authority.  Perhaps,  learned  Law  Officer  has  raised 
such plea in oblivion of the following observation of respondent 
No.2 in order, dated 28.04.2001: -

A  perusal of  the above-quoted  portion  from  the order  passed by 
respondent  No.2  shows  that  he  took  cognizance  of  the  matter 
upon reference by respondent No.1 and to fortify his observation 
he  has  referred  to  certain  communications  but  those  have  not 
been  discussed  in  the  impugned  order  meaning  thereby  that  the 
same has been passed without appreciating the relevant material. 
18.  Learned  Law  Officer  as  well  as  the  learned  counsel 
appearing  on  behalf  of  Settlement  department  have  repeatedly 
argued 
that  as  the  land  in  question  was  earmarked  for 
construction of International Hotel the same was not available for 
allotment  under  Settlement  Laws.  The  said  assertion  cannot  be 
given  any  weightage  for  the  reason  that  in  order,  dated 
28.04.2001, respondent No.2, while dealing with said limb of the 
matter has inter-alia concluded as under:

As  per  afore-quoted  portion  from  order  of  respondent  No.2  the 
Sponsor  abandoned  the  idea  of  construction  of  International 
Hotel at the site in the year 1997 whereas allotment in favour of 
legal  heirs  of  Ghulam  Abbas  was  made  in  the  year  2001,  thus, 
prima-facie  the  condition  stipulated  in  Notification,  dated 
16.05.1973, 
that  Building  Site  cannot  be  allotted  under 
Settlement Laws was not attracted in the case in hand. 
19.  A  perusal  of  the  impugned  order  shows  that  respondent 
No.1  proceeded  to  annul  the  allotment  made  in  favour  of  legal 
heirs  of  Ghualm  Abbas  on  the  ground  that  at  the  relevant  time 
their case did not fall within the definition of “pending cases” in 
terms  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975.  In  this  regard,  I  am  of  the  view 
that  the  said  plea  being  contrary  to  the  findings  of  this  Court 
contained  in  Para  No.10  of  judgment,  dated  26.09.1993  is  not 
sustainable.  
Considering  from  another  angle,  legal  heirs  of  Ghulam 
Abbas  filed  W.P.  No.3715/1996/BWP  before  this  Court  which 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--21-- 
came  up  for  final  hearing  on  20.10.1996  when  the  same  was 
disposed of in the following terms: - 
“The learned Assistant Advocate General, who has entered 
appearance  on  Court’s  call,  assures  that  the  respondent 
will decide the matter strictly in accordance with the order 
of  this  Court  dated  26-9-1993  passed  in  Civil  Revision 
No.415-D/89 (annexure ‘A’), within three months from the 
receipt  of  this  order.  In  view  of  this,  learned  counsel  for 
the petitioners does not press  instant petition but reserves 
his  right  to  come  to  this  Court  if  need  arises.  Order 
accordingly. Disposed of as requested.” 
 
From  the  above-quoted  order,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  the 
learned  Law  Officer  gave  assurance  that  the  matter  shall  be 
decided  in  accordance  with  judgment,  dated  26.09.1993,  passed 
by  this  Court  in  C.R.  No.415-D/1989.  If  the  matter  was  not 
covered under the definition of pending proceedings there was no 
compulsion  for  the  learned  Law  Officer  to  give  such  assurance. 
Further,  when  the  department  did  not  bother  to  challenge  the 
judgment  of  this  Court,  dated  26-09-1993,  the  Chief  Settlement 
Commissioner could not withdraw the allotment  made in favour 
of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas on the ground that at the time of 
allotment  their  case  did  not  fall  within  the  category  of  pending 
proceedings.   
20. 
It  is  very  ironical  to  note  that  respondent  No.1  while 
passing  the impugned  order in  Para  No.2  of  his order has  relied 
upon the opinion of the legal advisor rendered in the year 2013. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--22-- 
There is nothing on record to show that in the year 2001 when the 
land was allotted in favour of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas it fell 
within the prohibited zone. The apex Court of the country while 
clinching  the  issue  under  discussion  in  the  case  reported  as 
Province  of  Punjab  through  Secretary  Colonies,  board  of 
revenue,  Lahore  and  others  v.  Ch.  Abdus  Sattar  (2012  SCMR 
1007) has inter-alia held as under: - 
5. 
Having  considered  the  submissions  made  and  the 
law  declared,  we  find  that  admittedly  when  the  land  was 
allotted to Abdul Rehman, the same did not fall within the 
prohibited  zone  and  therefore,  would  not  be  hit  by  a 
subsequent notification to which reference has been made 
above. This court was seized of a similar issue in Province 
of  Punjab  through  District  Collector  Vehari  v.  Ghulam 
Muhammad (1994 SCMR 975) wherein the judgment of the 
learned  High  Court  was  not  interfered  with  because  "as 
regards the prohibited zone, the instructions were that the 
distance  should  be  measured  as  required  when  the 
allotment was made and not as when the proprietary rights 
are conferred. On this test, the allotment of the respondent 
was beyond three miles limits then applicable to him when 
he  got  the  allotment  but  within  five  miles  i.e.,  with  the 
limits  when  he  was  to  be  given  proprietary  rights.  The 
Collector applied the latter." (Emphasis is supplied).” 
If the impugned order is adjudged on the touchstone of the afore-
quoted  verdict  of  the  apex  Court  of  the  country  there  leaves  no 
ambiguity  that  respondent  No.1  while  deciding  the  matter 
omitted  to  consider  said  important  aspect.  There  is  nothing  on 
record that in the year 2001 when the land was allotted in favour 
of  legal  heirs  of  Ghulam  Abbas  it  fell  within  the  limits  of 
Municipal  Committee  Rahimyar  Khan  or  it  was  declared  as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--23-- 
Building  Site  rendering  it  immune  from  allotment  under 
Settlement Laws.  
21. 
It  is  admitted  position  that  respondent  No.2  was  enjoying 
powers of the Notified Officer/Deputy Settlement Commissioner 
in the year 2001 at Sub Divisional level, thus, the order passed by 
him  could  not  be  reviewed  by  respondent  No.1  while  dealing 
with miscellaneous application filed by legal heirs of Rehmat Ali 
for  allotment  of  land  in  lieu  of  their  56  pending  PIUs.  In  this 
regard, reliance can be placed on the case of Nawab Din (Supra) 
wherein a line of distinction has been drawn between the cases of 
genuine  claimants  and  those  whose  claims  from  the  inception 
were  found  to  be  bogus.  In  the  latter  category,  the  Chief 
Settlement  Commissioner  enjoys  all  persuasive  powers  to  annul 
any  allotment  whereas  the  allotment  of  land  on  the  basis  of 
verified claims is immune from review by the said authority. 
22. 
It  is  very  strange  to  note  that  though  the  name  of  Abdul 
Shakoor, petitioner in the instant petition, was incorporated in the 
revenue record in the year 2001 on the basis of Mutation of sale 
bearing  No.5739,  dated  30.10.2001,  but  while  filing 
the 
application  the  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  did  not  array  him  as 
party  seemingly  to  keep  him  aloof  from  the  proceedings  being 
conducted by the Chief Settlement Commissioner, Punjab. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--24-- 
23. 
It  is  not  out  of  place  to  mention  over  here  that  prior  to 
filing  application  before  respondent  No.1  in  the  year  2012,  the 
legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  filed  multiple  Writ  Petitions  (referred 
above) before this Court wherein they only prayed for allotment 
of land against 56 pending PIUs but in none of them they prayed 
for cancellation of land from the name of legal heirs of Ghulam 
Abbas, however, while filing application before respondent No.1 
they,  in  addition  to  praying  for  allotment  of  land  against  their 
pending  PIUs,  also  requested  for  cancellation of  land  allotted in 
favour of legal heirs of  Ghulam  Abbas. This  fact shows  that  for 
the  first  time  they  changed  their  stance  after  eleven  years  of 
allotment of land in favour of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas. 
24.  Considering from another aspect, legal heirs of Rehmat Ali 
could move for allotment of land against their pending PIUs but 
they  had  no  cheeks  to  move  for  cancellation  of  land  already 
transferred in the name of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas and being 
a  past  and  close  transaction  same  was  not  open  for  interference 
by any authority working under Settlement Laws but respondent 
No.1  while  deciding  the  matter  did  not  consider  the  said 
important fact. 
25.  Learned  Additional  Advocate  General  with  a  view  to 
establish  that  at  the  time  of  allotment  of  land  in  favour  of  legal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--25-- 
heirs of Ghulam Abbas the same fell within the municipal limits 
of  Rahimyar  Khan 
has 
referred 
to  Notification 
No.LGA/526/3447-50,  dated  10.03.1986, 
issued  by 
the 
Commissioner,  Bahawalpur  Division,  Bahawalpur.  In  the  said 
Notification,  while  defining 
the 
limits  of 
the  Municipal 
Committee  Rahimyar  Khan,  names  of  Mauza  Colony  Mills, 
Usman  Colony,  Basti  Samiullah  alongwith  Dera  Jats,  Housing 
Scheme-C  alongwith  Dera  Jats,  Hakam  Chand,  Dera  Jats 
Residential,  Tibbi  Larra  etc.  have  been  included  but  name  of 
Mauza  Bandur  is  not  there.    Prima  facie  it  depicts  that  at  the 
relevant  time  Mauza  Bandur  was  not  situated  within  the 
territorial limits of Municipal Committee, Rahimyar Khan.  
26.  As  far  as  the  Notifications  produced  by  the  learned  Law 
Officer  relating  to  extension  of  urban  area  for  levy  of  Capital 
Value  Tax  (CVT)  are  concerned,  they  are  of  no  help  to  the 
respondents firstly for the reason that the same have been issued 
in  the  year  2012  and  2015  whereas  allotment  in  favour  of  legal 
heirs of Ghulam Abbas was made in the year 2001 and secondly 
the said Notifications cannot be considered as conclusive proof of 
the territorial limits of the Municipal Committee Rahimyar Khan. 
27.  Now taking up the connected petition, I have observed that 
Rehmat Ali filed application alongwith reminder in the year 1973 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--26-- 
which  remained  pending  till  the  year  2000.  As  the  application 
submitted  by  Rehmat  Ali  was  not  being  decided  by  the 
authorities  concerned,  his 
legal  heirs  filed  Writ  Petition 
No.3632/2000  before  this  Court  which  was  disposed  of  on 
11.08.2000  while issuing direction to the competent authority to 
decide the matter. Pursuant to said order respondent No.2 took up 
the  matter  and  decided  the  same  on  06.01.2001  whereby 
application  submitted  by  Rehmat  Ali  was  dismissed.  After 
dismissal  of  application  by  respondent  No.2,  the  legal  heirs  of 
Rehmat  Ali 
tried 
their 
luck  before 
the  District  Officer 
(Revenue)/Collector but without any success as he dismissed the 
same  vide  order,  dated  9.07.2002.  Further,  respondent  No.2 
passed order on 06.01.2001, in presence of legal heirs of Rehmat 
Ali  but  while  filing  the  connected  petition  in  the  year  2015, 
neither  they  have  referred  to  the  orders  passed  by  the  Assistant 
Commissioner/Notified Officer and the District Collector, Rahim 
Yar  Khan  nor  have  challenged  them,  thus,  their  prayer  for 
allotment  of  land  against  56  pending  PIUs  after  setting  aside  of 
order  passed  by  the  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner  cannot  be 
acceded  to.  As  concealment  of  material  facts  on  the  part  of  the 
legal heirs of Rehmat Ali (petitioners in connected Writ Petition) 
is floating on the surface they are not entitled to equitable relief 
from  this  Court  in  exercise  of  Constitutional  jurisdiction  vested 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--27-- 
under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan,  1973  as  held  by  the  apex  Court  of  the  country  in  the 
case  reported  as  Rehmat  Din  and  others  v.  Mirza  Nasir  Abbas 
and others (2007 SCMR 1560). 
28.  The  contumacious  conduct  of  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali 
(petitioners  in  connected  Writ  Petition)  is  also  established  from 
the  fact  that  though  in  Para  No.11  of  the  petition  they  have 
referred  to  report,  dated  11.01.2001,  regarding  availability  of 
land  for  allotment  against  the  pending  PIUs  pursuant  to  the 
assumption  of  cognizance  by  respondent  No.2  but  knowingly 
concealed  the  fact  of  passing  of  the  order  by  the  Assistant 
Commissioner after submission of said reports and turning down 
their request by the District Collector, Rahim Yar Khan. 
29.  According  to  the  prayer  clause  of  the  connected  petition, 
legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  have  prayed  for  allotment  of  land 
against  their  56  pending  PIUs.  As  per  respondent  No.1,  since 
their case did not fall within the category of pending cases as no 
proceedings  for  allotment  of  land  against  the  said  units  was 
pending  before  any  competent  forum  in  terms  of  Repeal  Act, 
1975,  they  were  not  entitled  for  allotment  of  land  rather  they 
could  move  to  receive  compensation.  Though  learned  counsel 
representing  the  legal  heirs  of  Rehmat  Ali  (petitioners  in  the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2809/2015. 
 
--28-- 
connected petition)  have  addressed the Court at great  length but 
have failed to establish that their claim to the extent of allotment 
of  land  against  56  PIUs  was  covered  under  the  definition  of 
pending  proceedings  in  terms  of  the  Repeal  Act,  1975.  Even 
otherwise,  when  the  petitioners  have  been  found  guilty  of 
concealment  of  material  facts  from  this  Court  they  are  not 
entitled to any equitable relief. 
30.  As  far  the  judgments  referred  by  respondent  No.1  in  his 
order  are  concerned,  suffice  it  to  note  that  while  deciding  the 
matter, he has misapplied the said judgments in the instant matter 
without formulating the points of controversy between the parties 
and their resolution on the basis of the record of the case. 
31.  As  a  necessary  corollary  to  the  discussion  made  in  the 
afore-going  paragraphs,  I  have  no  hesitation  to  hold  that  while 
deciding  the  matter  respondent  No.1  has  omitted  to  consider 
material facts which had important bearing on the outcome of the 
lis  between 
the  parties.  Consequently, 
instant  petition 
is 
accepted,  the  order  impugned  to  the  extent  of  cancellation  of 
land from the name of legal heirs of Ghulam Abbas  is set aside 
and  the  matter  is  remanded  to  respondent  No.1  for  decision 
afresh after verifying certain facts referred Supra and those which 
are part of order passed by respondent No.1.

32.  As  far  as  the  connected  petition is concerned, the  same  is 
dismissed.
