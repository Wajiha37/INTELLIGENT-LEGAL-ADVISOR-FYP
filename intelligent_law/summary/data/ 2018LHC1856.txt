petitions,  to  wit,  Writ  Petition  No.196881  of  2018,  Writ  Petition 
No.208646  of  2018,  Writ  Petition  No.228253  of  2018,  Writ  Petition 
No.230166  of  2018  and  Writ  Petition  No.  229885  of  2018  raise 
common  issue  for  decision  before  this  Court,  they  were  heard  and 
decided concomitantly through a short order dated 31st August, 2018 
which reads as under:- 
―For  the  reasons  to  be  recorded  later,  we  declare  that  after 
promulgation  of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment) 
Act,  2010,  the  National  Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  still 
exits and is in force and consequently this petition along with 
connected petitions is dismissed.‖ 
 
2. 
3. 
Here are the reasons for the above short order. 
The seminal question that hinges for consideration of this Court 
is as to whether the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 made in 
pursuance  of  the  Provisional  Constitution  Order  No.1  of  1999  after 
promulgation of the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, 
has ceased to be a law and is non-existent, non-est and a dead letter. 
The  argument  propounded  in  these  petitions  is  that  on  4th  October, 
1999  two  instruments  were  made  and  enforced.  The  first  was  the 
Proclamation  of  Emergency  through  which  the  Constitution  of  the 
2 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 was held in abeyance, whereas the 
second  was  the  Provisional  Constitution  Order  No.1  of  1999  which 
was  subsequently  amended  by 
the  Provisional  Constitution 
(Amendment)  Order  9  of  1999  declaring 
that  an  Ordinance 
promulgated  by  the  President  and  by  the  Governor  of  the  province 
would not be subject to the limitation as to its duration prescribed in 
the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973.  In 
pursuance of above stated instruments, the President promulgated the 
National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 which continued in force till 
the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010.  However,  after 
enforcement  of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010 
amending the Constitution of the Islamic  Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
comprehensively  and  by  virtue  of  its  Article  270-AA,  the  National 
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 lost the protection of the Provisional 
Constitution  Order  No.1  of  1999  as  amended  by  the  Provisional 
Constitution  Order  No.9  of  1999  and  thus  by  automatic  operation  of 
law  came  under  limitation  period  of  120  days  as  provided  in  Article 
89  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973. 
Since  the  National  Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  was  not  laid 
before  the  appropriate  legislature  within  the  prescribed  period  of 
limitation, it  had  become  dead  from  18th  August, 2010.  The  bedrock 
of  the  above  arguments  is  the  judgment  rendered  by  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case  of  “Sindh  High  Court  Bar 
Association  through  its  Secretary  and  another  v.  Federation  of 
Pakistan  through  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice, 
Islamabad and others” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 879). 
4. 
To appreciate the points that have been canvassed before us,  it 
will  be  essential  to  narrate  briefly  the  relevant  historical  background 
of the constitutional legislation, jurisprudence developed thereon and 
accountability law. We will begin the chronology from 12th  October, 
1999  when  General  Pervez  Musharraf,  the  then  Chief  of  Army  Staff 
by  taking  extra  constitutional  measure  seized  power  and  suspended 
the  government  on  the  ground  of  politicizing  army,  destabilizing  it 
and  trying  to  create  the  dissension  within  its  rank.  On  14th  October, 
3 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
1999  Proclamation  of  Emergency  effective  from  12th  October,  1999 
was  issued.  According  to  this  Proclamation,  the  Constitution  of  the 
Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  (“the  Constitution”)  was  held  in 
abeyance;  the  President  of  Pakistan  was  allowed  to  continue    in 
office; the  National Assembly, the Provincial Assemblies and Senate 
stood  suspended;  the  Chairman  and  Deputy  Chairman  of  the  Senate; 
the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and the 
Provincial  Assemblies  stood  suspended;  the  Prime  Minister,  the 
Federal Ministers, Ministers, Ministers of State, Advisors to the Prime 
Minister,  Parliamentary  Secretaries,  the  Provincial  Advisors  to  the 
Chief Ministers were ceased to hold offices and whole of the Pakistan 
came under the control of the Armed Forces of Pakistan. The Chief of 
Army Staff on 14th October, 1999 also issued Provisional Constitution 
Order  No.1  of  1999  (“PCO  No.1  of  1999”)  wherein  it  was  inter-alia 
provided  that  notwithstanding  the  abeyance  of  the  provisions  of  the 
Constitution and subject to that Order and any other Orders made by 
the  Chief  Executive:  (a)  Pakistan  would  be  governed,  as  nearly  as 
may  be,  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution;and,  (b)  all  laws  other 
than  the  Constitution  would  continue  in  force  until  altered,  amended 
or  repealed  by  the  Chief  Executive  or  any  authority  designated  by 
him.  Subsequently,  on  15th  November,  1999 
the  Provisional 
Constitution  (Amendment)  Order  No.9  of  1999  (“PCO  No.9  of 
1999”)  was  promulgated  through  which  Article  No.5-A  was  inserted 
in  the  PCO  No.1 of 1999. The  effect of the amendment  was that  the 
Ordinance  promulgated  by  the  President  or  by  the  Governor  of  the 
Province  would  not  be  subject  to  the  limitation  as  to  its  duration 
prescribed  in  the  Constitution.  This  effect  was  also  applied  to  the 
Ordinance  issued  by  the  President  or  by  the  Governor  which  was  in 
force  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  the  Proclamation  of 
Emergency  dated  the  14th  October,  1999.  In  pursuance  of  the 
aforesaid  Proclamation  and  PCO  No.1 of  1999 as  well  as  PCO  No.9 
of  1999  the  President  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  on  11th 
November,  1999  promulgated  National  Accountability  Bureau 
Ordinance No.XVIII of 1999. The word “Bureau” stood omitted from 
4 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
the title of the said Ordinance by virtue of Ordinance No.CXXXIII of 
2002  dated  23rd  November,  2002.  Now  the  title  of  the  Ordinance  is 
“The  National  Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  (“the  NAO,  1999”). 
The object of the NAO,1999 was/is to provide for effective measures 
for  the  detection,  investigation,  prosecution  and  speedy  disposal  of 
cases involving corruption, corrupt practices, misuse/abuse of power, 
misappropriation  of  property,  taking  of  kickbacks,  commissions  and 
for matters connected and ancillary or incidental thereto. 
5. 
The army take-over, Proclamation of Emergency, PCO No.1 of 
1999  along  with  other  Orders  were  challenged  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Syed Zafar Ali Shah and 
others v. General Pervez Musharraf, Chief Executive of Pakistan 
and others” (PLD 2000 Supreme Court 869). Vide judgment dated 
12th May, 2000 the action of 12th October, 1999 was held valid on the 
basis  of  doctrine  of  State  necessity  and  the  principle  of  salus  populi 
est  suprema  lex  and  General  Pervez  Musharraf  was  held  entitled  to 
perform  all  acts,  or  legislative  measures,  which  were  in  accordance 
with  or  could  have  been  made  under  the  Constitution  including  the 
power  to  amend  it  and  to  perform  all  such  measures  as  would 
establish or lead to the establishment of his declared objectives. As to 
the  power 
to  amend 
the  Constitution,  it  was  held  that  the 
constitutional amendments could  be resorted to, for a period of three 
years  with  effect  from  12th  October,  1999,  only  if  the  Constitution 
failed  to  provide  a  solution  for  the  attainment  of  his  declared 
objectives, but no amendment would be made in the salient feature of 
the  Constitution,  that  is,  the  independence  of  judiciary,  federalism, 
parliamentary  form  of  Government  blended  with  Islamic  Provisions. 
Review  of  Zafar  Ali  Shah’s  case  (supra)  was  sought  but  it  was 
dismissed  vide  judgment  dated  7th  February,  2001  reported  as 
“Wasim  Sajjad  and  others  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  through 
Secretary,  Cabinet  Division  and  others”    (PLD  2001  Supreme 
Court 233). 
6. 
Pursuant  to  the  judgment  of  Zafar  Ali  Shah’s  case,  firstly,  the 
PCO  No.1  of  1999  was  amended  through  Provisional  Constitution 
5 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
(Amendment)  Order,  2000  (Chief  Executive’s  Order  No.10  of  2000) 
dated  14.11.2000,  so  as  to  provide  that  the  words  “Prime  Minister” 
and  the  words  “Chief  Minister,”  wherever  occurring,  would  be 
deemed  to  be  substituted  by  the  words  “Chief  Executive  of  the 
Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan”  and  “Governor”  respectively;  and, 
secondly,  on  20th  June,  2001  the  President’s  Succession  Order,  2001 
(Chief  Executive’s  Order  No.III  of  2011)  was  promulgated  and  in 
pursuance whereof General Pervez Musharraf became President of the 
country.  Later  on,  by  means  of  Chief  Executive’s  Order  No.XII  of 
2002  dated  30th  April,  2002  General  Pervez  Musharraf  held 
referendum  asking  for  a  vote  on  his  continuation  in  the  office  of 
President for next five years. He was returned with more than 99% of 
the polled votes. 
7. 
At the fag end of three years granted in Zafar Ali Shah’s case, 
General  Pervez  Musharraf  made  number  of  amendments  in  the 
Constitution 
through:  (i) 
the  Legal  Framework  Order  (Chief 
Executive’s  Order  No.24  of  2002)  dated  21st  August,  2002;  (ii)  the 
Legal Framework (Amendment) Order 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order 
No.29  of  2002)  dated  9th  October,  2002;  and  (iii)    the  Legal 
Framework  (Second  Amendment)  Order  2002  (Chief  Executive’s 
Order 32 of 2002) dated 26th October, 2002. One of the effects of the 
amendments made through the Legal Framework Orders was that the 
NAO, 1999 was not only continued in force but also made part of the 
Sixth  Schedule  to  the  Constitution,  consequently  it  could  not  be 
altered, repealed or amended expressly or impliedly without the prior 
sanction  of  the  President  accorded  after  consultation  with  the  Prime 
Minister;  and,  that  this  protection  was  for  a  limited  period  of  six 
years.  The  amendments  made  in  the  Constitution  through  the  Legal 
Framework Order, 2002 were challenged before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  by  means  of  a  Constitutional  Petition  filed  by  the 
Watan  Party.  This  petition  was  dismissed  vide  judgment    dated  7th 
October, 2002 reported as “Watan Party through Punjab President 
Ladies  Wing  Tasneem  Shaukat  Khan  v.  Chief  Executive 
President  of  Pakistan,  and  another”  (PLD  2003  Supreme  Court 
6 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
74)  on  the  ground  that  the  petitioner  had  no  locus  standi  to  file  the 
same.  Since  the  elected  Parliament  was  in  immediate  sight,  it  was 
held in that judgment that Parliament and not the Supreme Court was 
the  appropriate  forum  to  consider  all  these  amendments  with  the 
observations that procedure to amend the Constitution as enshrined in 
Article  239,  Part  XI  remained  unaltered  and  the  Parliament  retained 
same  power  to  amend  the  Constitution  as  it  did  before  the 
promulgation of the Legal Framework Order. 
8. 
On  10th  October,  2002  complying  with  the  direction  given  in 
Zafar  Ali  Shah’s  case,  elections  to  the  National  Assembly  and  the 
Provincial  Assemblies  were  held.  Vide  Notification  dated  15th 
November, 2002 certain Articles of the Constitution were revived and 
on  16th  November,  2002  General  Pervez  Musharraf  took  oath  of  the 
office of President and members of the National Assembly were also 
sworn  in.  Subsequently,  through  Notification  dated  20th  November, 
2002  remaining  Articles  of  the  Constitution  were  revived.  The 
Members  of  the  Senate  took  oath  on  23rd  November,  2002  whereas 
the  Chief  Ministers  of  the  Provinces  were  sworn  in  on  12th  March, 
2003. 
9. 
The  provisions  of  the  Legal  Framework  Order  through  which 
amendments  were  made  in  the  Constitution  were  one  of  the 
contentious  issue  before  the  new  Members  of  the  Parliament  and 
resultantly  as  per  observations  made  in  the  Watan  Party’s  case  they 
undertook  exercise  to  review  the  same  which  ultimately  culminated 
on  31st  December,  2003  when 
the  Constitution  (Seventeenth 
Amendment)  Act,  2003  was  promulgated.  By  virtue  of  Article  9  of 
the  Constitution 
(Seventeenth  Amendment)  Act,  2003 
the 
constitutional status given to the NAO, 1999 was withdrawn and the 
same stood omitted from the  Sixth Schedule to the Constitution. The 
Parliament  also  granted  validation  and  affirmation  to  laws  made 
between 12th October, 1999 and 31st December, 2003 (that is date on 
which  the  Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment)  Act,  2003  came 
into  force).  In  this  context  Article  270-AA  of  the  Constitution  was 
also amended and substituted with the following:

Clause  (2)  or  in  execution  of  or  in  compliance  with  orders 
made or sentences passed in exercise or purported exercise of 
such powers. 
(5)   For  the  purposes  of  Clauses  (1),  (2)  and  (4),  all  orders

made,  taken  or  done  by  any  authority  or  person  shall  be 
deemed  to  have  been  made,  taken  or  done  in  good  faith  and 
for the purpose intended to be served thereby. 
10.  Upon analysis of different clauses of Article 270-AA provided 
by  the  Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment)  Act,  2003  it  will 
appear that Clause (1) dealt with the validation of the Proclamation of 
Emergency  of  14th  October,  1999  whereby  whole  of  the  Pakistan 
came under the control of the Armed Forces of Pakistan and all laws, 
whether  of  constitutional  nature  or  of  ordinary  kind  made  between 
12th  October, 1999  and  the  date  on  which  the  said  Article  came  into 
force.  Clause  (2)  was  confined  to  the  validity  conferred  on  actions 
taken  in  exercise  of  powers  derived  from  the  legal  instruments  and 
laws, not only those mentioned in Clause (1) but all laws and orders 
passed  by  any  authority,  during  the  period  mentioned  in  Clause  (1). 
Clause (3) made provisions for continuation of all laws which were in 
force  immediately  before  the  date  on  which  the  Article  came  into 
force.  Clause  (4)  was  indemnity  clause  for  protection  of  authorities 
and  persons  for  action  taken  during  the  relevant  period.  Clause  (5) 
was  deeming  provision  declaring  all  measures  and  actions  taken  as 
referred  to  in  Clauses  (1),  (2)  and  (4)  to  have  been  made,  taken  or 
done in good faith. There was yet another important feature of Article 
270-AA.    Clause  (1)  of  Article  270-AA  proclaimed  that  the  laws  in 
question    “are  affirmed  ,  adopted  and  declared  to  have  been  validly 
made by the competent authority and notwithstanding contained in the 
Constitution shall not be called in question in any Court or forum on 
any  ground  whatsoever”.  According  to  the  case  of  “Miss  Benazir 
Bhutto  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  another”  (PLD  1988 
9 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
Supreme  Court  416)  the  word  “affirm”,  inter-alia  means  to  ratify, 
whereas the word “adopt” means to  make that one’s own (property or 
act)  which  was  not  so  originally.  And  the  word  “declare”  is  defined 
“to  make  known,  manifest  or  clear”.  Applying  the  said  meaning  of 
crucial words, the effect of Clause (1) of Article 270-AA was that the 
specified  laws  (including  the  NAO,  1999)  were  validated  and 
although  they  were  not  enacted  by  any  law-making  authority  known 
to  the  Constitution  were  adopted  as  though  made  by  the  appropriate 
legislature  under  the  Constitution  and  were  pronounced  by  the  force 
of  the  constitutional  provision  to  have  been  made  by  the  competent 
law-making  authority  established  by  the  Constitution.  Thus,  Article 
270-AA  was  a  constitutional  device  to  confer  validity  upon  the 
specified laws by the exercise of constituent power and to give them 
the status of  competently  enacted  laws, to  remove  the  blemish,  as  to 
their  maker.  This  was  necessary 
in  order 
to  overcome 
the 
unconstitutionality  of  the  laws  for  lack  of  legislative  power  because 
under  the  Constitution  legislative  power  vested  in  the  organs 
institutionalized  by  the  Constitution,  and  not  in  an  authority  outside 
the  contemplation  of  the  Constitution.  The  affirmation,  adoption  and 
declaration  of  validity  conferred  upon  the  laws  mentioned  in  Clause 
(1)  of  Article  270-AA,  both  as  to  the  lack  of  legislative  authority  as 
well  as  to  the  content  of  the  laws,  inasmuch  as  they  were  to  be 
regarded  as  validly  enacted  laws,  at  par  with  other  laws  which  were 
passed by the legislature constituted under the Constitution.   
11.  On  a  plain  reading  of  Article  277-AA  (3)  it  appears  clear  that 
all  proclamations,  President’s  Orders,  Ordinances,  Chief  Executive’s 
Orders, laws, enactments etc. which were in force immediately before 
the date on which this Article came into force were continued in force 
and  the  appropriate  legislature  was    authorized  to  alter,  repeal  or 
amend  the  same.  The  object  of  this  provision  was  to  maintain 
continuity of the pre-existing laws after the Constitution (Seventeenth 
Amendment)  Act,  2003  came  into  force  till  they  were  repealed, 
altered  or  amended  by  the  competent  authority.  Without  the  aid  of 
such  provision  there  would  have  been  utter  confusion  in  the  field  of 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
law.  In  this  perspective  Clause  (3)  of  Article  270-AA  posited  the 
continuation of the NAO, 1999 until altered, repealed or amended by 
10 
the competent authority.   
12.  Needless to observe here that grafting of the Legal Framework 
Order,  2002,  in  the  body  of  the  Constitution,  the  Constitution 
(Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 2003, the vote of confidence and the 
notification of General Pervez Musharraf as Chief of Army Staff and 
President  of  Pakistan  were  also  challenged  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  but  the  petition  was  dismissed  vide 
judgment  dated  13th  April,  2005  which  is  reported  as  “Pakistan 
Lawyer Forum and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others” 
(PLD 2005 Supreme Court 719). 
13.   On  3rd  November,  2007  Proclamation  of  Emergency, 
Provisional Constitution Order No.1 of 2007 and Oath Order of 2007 
were  promulgated.  The  first  and  second  instruments  were  issued  by 
the Chief of Army Staff whereas the third was issued by the President 
of Pakistan. The striking features of the said instruments were: (a) that 
the  Constitution  was  held  in  abeyance  and  Pakistan  made  to  be 
governed as nearly as may be, in accordance with the Constitution but 
subject to Provisional Constitution Order No.1 of 2007 and any other 
Order  issued  by  the  General  Pervez  Musharraf    as  President;  (b) 
executive  and  legislature  were  continued;  (c)  Federal,  Provincial 
Governments,  that  is,  Prime  Minister,  Federal  State  Ministers,  Chief 
Ministers  and  Provincial  Ministers  continued  in  office;  (d)  the 
Chairman/Deputy  Chairman  Senate  and  the  Speaker/Deputy  Speaker 
of  National  Assembly  also  continued  in  office;  (e)  the  National 
Assembly  and  Provincial  Assemblies  continued  and  they  were 
allowed to complete their term of five years.  During the period w.e.f. 
3rd  November,  2007  to  15th  December,  2007  General  Pervez 
Musharraf,  as  President  of  Pakistan,  purported  to  make  amendments 
in the Constitution, inter-alia, protecting his own actions by insertion 
of  Article  270-AAA  in  the  Constitution.  On  28th  November,  2007 
General  Pervez  Musharraf  relinquished  the  office  of  Chief  of  Army 
Staff  and  on  15th  December,  2007  by  means  of  Revocation  of 
11 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
Proclamation  of  Emergency  Order,  2007  he  revoked  the  emergency 
imposed  on  3rd  November,  2007  and  restored  the  Constitution  as 
amended  by  him.  The  said  instruments  and  amendments  were 
challenged before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of “Tikka Iqbal Muhammad Khan and others v. General Pervez 
Musharraf and others”  (PLD 2008 Supreme Court 178). The said 
case was dismissed through judgment dated 23rd November, 2007 and 
the  above  said  three  instruments  and  the  amendments  made  in  the 
Constitution  were  declared  valid  under  the  principle  of  salus  populi 
suprema lex.  
14.  General  Elections  were  held  on  8th  February  2008  and  as 
consequence  whereof,  the  National  Assembly  and  the  Provincial 
Assemblies came into existence and Governments at the Federal and 
Provincial levels were formed. In the wake of resolution passed by all 
the  four  Provincial  Assemblies  calling  upon  General  Pervez 
Musharraf  to  quit  the  office  of  President  otherwise  impeachment 
resolution would be moved against him, he resigned from the office of 
the President on 18th August, 2008 and elections for the office of the 
President  were  held  on  6th  September,  2008  wherein  Mr.  Asif  Ali 
Zardari was returned as the successful candidate. 
15.  The  Proclamation  of  Emergency,  Provisional  Constitution 
Order  No.1  of  2007,  Oath  Order,  2007,  amendments  made  in  the 
Constitution  through  Legal  Framework  Orders  and  the  judgment 
rendered  in  the  Tikka  Iqbal  Muhammad  Khan‘s  case  came  under 
consideration  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the 
case of “Sindh High Court Bar Association through its Secretary 
and  another  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  through  Secretary, 
Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,  Islamabad  and  others”  (PLD  2009 
Supreme  Court  879).  In  this  case,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan  declared  the  Proclamation  of  Emergency  and  Provisional 
Constitutional  Order  No.1  of  2007  unconstitutional,  void,  ab-initio; 
and,  that  Ordinances  issued  during  the  period  w.e.f.  3rd  November, 
2007  to  15th  December,  2007  ceased  to  be  permanent  laws  with  the 
result  that  life  of  such  Ordinances  would  be  limited  to  the  period 
12 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
specified  under  Articles  89  and  128  of  the  Constitution,  viz,  four 
month  and 
three  moths  respectively  from 
the  date  of 
their 
promulgation. The discussion with regard to Ordinances made during 
the  said  period  is  available  in  paragraph  186,187  and  188  of  the 
judgment  and  the  same  being  relevant  for  determination  of question, 
under discussion, is reproduced below: 
 
―186.Proclamation  of  Emergency  and  PCO  No.1  of 
2007 having been declared unconstitutional and void ab initio 
and the validity purportedly conferred on all such Ordinances 
by  means  of  Article  270-AAA  and  by  the  judgment  in  Tikka 
Iqbal  Muhammad  Khan‘s  case  also  having  been  shorn,  such 
Ordinances would cease to be permanent laws with the result 
that the life of such Ordinances would be limited to the period 
specified in Articles 89 and 128 of the Constitution, viz. , four 
months  and  three  months  respectively  from  the  date  of  their 
promulgation.  Under  Article  89  of  the  Constitution,  and 
Ordinances  issued  by  the  President,  if  not  so  laid  before  the 
National  Assembly,  or  both  Houses  of  Parliament  stands 
repealed  on  expiration  of  four  months  from  its  promulgation. 
Similarly, under Article 128 of the Constitution, an Ordinance 
issued  by  the  Governor,  if  not  so  laid  before  the  concerned 
Provincial  Assembly,  stands  repealed  on  expiration  of  three 
months from its promulgation. 
  
187.  It  may  be  noted  that  such  Ordinances  were 
continued in force throughout under a wrong notion that they 
had  become  permanent  laws.  Thus,  the  fact  remains  that  on 
the  touchstone  of  the  provisions  of  Articles  89  and  128  read 
with  Article  264  of  the  Constitution  and  section  6  of  the 
General  Clauses  Act,  1897,  only  such  rights,  privileges, 
obligations, or liabilities would lawfully be protected as were 
acquired,  accrued  or  incurred  under  the  said  Ordinances 
during the period of four months or three months, as the case 
may  be,  from  their  promulgation,  whether  before  or  after  3rd 
November,  2007  and  not  thereafter,  until  such  Ordinances 
were  enacted  as  Acts  by  the  Parliament  or  the  concerned 
Provincial Assembly with retrospective effect.  
  
188.  In  the  light  of  above  the  question  of  validation  of 
such  Ordinances  would  be  required  to  be  decided  by  the 
Parliament or the concerned Provincial Assemblies. However, 
the  period  of  four  months  and  three  months  mentioned 
respectively  in  Articles  89  and  128  of  the  Constitution  would 
be deemed to commence from the date of short order passed in 
this case on 31st July, 2009 and steps may be taken to lay such 
Ordinances before the Parliament or the respective Provincial 
Assemblies  in  accordance  with  law  during  the  aforesaid 
periods.  This  extension  of  time  has  been  allowed  in  order  to 
acknowledge 
trichotomy  of  powers  as 
enshrined  in  the  Constitution,  to  preserve  continuity,  to 
prevent  disorder,  to  protect  private  rights,  to  strengthen  the 
the  doctrine  of 
13 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
democratic  institutions  and  to  enable  them  to  perform  their 
Constitutional  functions,  which  they  were  unconstitutionally 
and illegally denied under PCO  No.1 of 2007. Needless to say 
that  any  validation  whether  with  retrospective  effect  or 
otherwise,  shall  always  be  subject  to    judicial  review  on  the 
well-recognized  principles of ultra vires, non-conformity with 
the Constitution or violation of the Fundamental Rights or on 
any other available ground.‖  
 
16.  The  new  Parliament  which  came  into  existence  after  the 
elections held in the year 2008 realizing the relentless struggle of the 
people  of  Pakistan  for  democracy,  thought  it  prudent  to  review  the 
constitutional  amendments  and  laws  so  as  to  attain  the  ideals  of  a 
Federal,  Islamic,  democratic,  parliamentary  and  modern  progressive 
welfare State, wherein the rights of the citizens were secured and the 
Provinces  had  equitable  share  in  the  Federation.  Thus  extensive 
exercise  was  undertaken  to  review  the  Constitution  and  finally  to 
achieve  the  above  stated  objectives,  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth 
Amendment) Act, 2010 was promulgated. It was for the first time that 
the  Parliament  refused  to  validate  extra-constitutional  actions  and 
measures  and  thus  by  repealing  the  Constitution  (Seventeenth 
Amendment)  Act,  2003  substituted  Article  270-AA  and  thereby 
declared  the  Proclamation  of  Emergency  of  14th  October,  1999,  the 
Provisional  Constitution  Order  No.1  of  1999  and  Oath  of  Judges 
Order  2000,  Chief  Executive’s  Order    No.19  of  2002,  Amendment 
made  in  the  Constitution  through  Legal  Framework  Order,  2002, 
Legal  Framework  (Amendment)  Order,  2002      and  the  Legal 
Framework  (Second  Amendment)  Order,  2002,  notwithstanding  any 
judgment of any Court including the Supreme Court or High Court as 
having  been  made  without  lawful  authority  and  of  no  legal  effect. 
After  having  given  the  above  declaration,  the  question  before  the 
Parliament  was  whether  the  Ordinances  promulgated  and  legislative 
measures  taken  by  the  President,  or  as  the  case  may  be,  by  the 
Governor,  which  in  force  at  the  time  of,  or  during  the  period  for 
which  the  Proclamation  of  Emergency  of  14th  October  1999  and 
Provisional  Constitution  Order  No.1  1999  held  the  field,  would 
continue  to  be  in  force.  There  were  two  principles  which  could  be 
14 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
taken  into  consideration  to  resolve  this  question.    The  first  principle 
was expounded by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of  “Miss  Asma  Jilani  vs.  The  Government  of  the  Punjab  and 
another”  (PLD  1972  Supreme  Court  139)  wherein  it  was  held  as 
follows:- 
―I too am of the opinion that recourse has to be taken to the 
doctrine of necessity where the ignoring of it would result in 
disastrous    consequences  to  the  body  politic  and  upset  the 
social  order  itself  but  I  respectfully  beg  to  disagree  with  the 
view  that  this  is  a  doctrine  for  validating  the  illegal  acts  of 
usurpers. In my humble opinion, this doctrine can be invoked 
in aid only after the Court has come to the conclusion that the 
acts  of  the  usurpers  were  illegal  and  illegitimate.  It  is  only 
then  that  the  question  arises  as  to  how  many  of  his  acts, 
legislative  or  otherwise,  should  be  condoned  or  maintained, 
notwithstanding their illegality in the  wider  public interest. I 
would  call 
this  a  principle  of  condonation  and  not 
legitimization. 
Applying this test I would condone (1) all transactions which 
are past and closed, for, no useful purpose can be served by 
re  opening    the  (2)  all  acts  and  legislative  measures  which 
are in accordance with, or could have been  made under,  the 
abrogated  Constitution  or  the  previous    legal  order,  (3)  all 
acts  which  tend  to  advance  or  promote    the  good  of  the 
people,  (4)  all  acts  required  to  be  done  for  the    ordinary 
orderly running of the  State and  all such measures as would 
establish  or    lead  to  the  establishment  of,  in  our  case,  the 
objectives  mentioned  in  the  Objectives  Resolution  of  1954.  I 
would not, however, condone any act intended to entrench the 
usurper  more  firmly  in  his  power  or  to  directly  help  him  to 
run  the  country  to  its  legitimate  objectives.  I  would  not  also 
condone  anything  which  seriously  impairs  the  rights  of  the 
citizens  except in so far  as they may be  designed  to advance 
the social welfare and national solidarity.‖ 
 
Second  Principle  was  settled  in  the  case  of  “Mehmood  Khan 
Achakzai and others v. Federation of Pakistan” (PLD 1997 
Supreme Court 426) wherein it was held as follows 
―The  learned  Advocate  for  the  respondents  and  the  learned 
amicus  curiae  have  contended  that  the  competency  of  the 
members  of  the  National  Assembly  is  protected  by  the 
doctrine of de facto. Reference has been made to Farzand Ali 
v. Province of West Pakistan PLD1970 SC 98 and Sabir Shah 
v  Federation  of  Pakistan  PLD  1994  SC  738.  This  is  a  well-
recognized  doctrine  embedded  in  our  jurisprudence.  Under 
this  doctrine  bona  fide  acts  in  public  interest  performed  by 
persons  assuming  authority which  turns  out to  be  illegal are 
assumed 
jure 
authority/person  and  binding.  This  doctrine  is  intended  to 
avoid dislocation, instability and confusion while declaring a 
to  have  been  performed  by  a  de 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
15 
de  facto  authority  illegal.  In  order  to  create  stability,  
regularity and to ―prevent confusion in the conduct of public 
business and insecurity of private rights the acts of the officer 
de facto are not suffered to be questioned because of want of 
legal  authority  except  by  some  direct  proceeding  instituted 
for  the  purpose  by  the  State  or  someone  claiming  office  de 
jure……….‖  (Constitutional  Limitations  by  Cooley  –  8th 
Edition  Vol.  2,  page  1357).  Besides,  this  Mr.  Khalid  Anwar 
has referred to Norton v Shebly County 118 US 425 where it 
was  observed  that  the  doctrine  of  de  facto  is  based  on 
considerations  of  policy  and  public  interest.  For  good  order 
and peace of society the title of persons in apparent authority 
is to be respected and obeyed until their title is investigated in 
some regular mode prescribed by law. In Gokaraju v State of 
Andhra  Parashad  AIR  1981  SC  1473  it  has  been  observed 
that ―the acts of the officer de facto performed by them within 
the  scope  of  their  assume  official  authority  in  the  interest  of 
the  public  or  third  persons  and  not  for  their  own  benefit  or 
generally  as  valid  and  binding  as  if  they  were  the  acts  of 
officer  de  jure‖.  This  doctrine  can  be  applied  if  the 
Parliament is  declared  to  be  illegally constituted  and  Eighth 
Amendment  is  declared  unconstitutional.  It  is  only  in  such 
situation  that  to  preserve  continuity,  prevent  disorder  and 
protect  private  rights,  this  doctrine  can  be  pressed  in 
service.‖ 
 
It  appears  that  the  Parliament  by  taking  into  consideration  the  above 
stated  two doctrines,  that  is, doctrine of  condonation  and  doctrine of 
de  facto  framed  Clause  (2)  of  Article  270-AA  of  the  Constitution 
which reads as under:- 
laws 
 (2)  Except  as  provided  in  clause  (1)  and  subject  to  the 
provisions  of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act, 
including  President‘s  Orders,  Acts, 
2010,  all 
Ordinances,  Chief  Executive‘s  Orders, 
regulations, 
enactments,  notifications,  rules,  orders  or  bye-laws  made 
between  the  twelfth  day  of  October,  one  thousand  nine 
hundred and ninety-nine and the thirty-first day of December, 
two thousand and three (both days inclusive) and still in force 
shall,  continue  to  be  in  force  until  altered,  repealed  or 
amended by the competent authority.  
Explanation.- For  the  purposes  of  clause  (2)  ‗and 
clause (6), ―competent authority‖ means,—  
(a)  in  respect  of  Presidents‘  Orders,  Ordinances,  Chief 
Executive‘s  Orders  and  all  other  laws,  the  appropriate 
Legislature; and  
(b) in respect of notifications, rules, orders and bye-laws, the 
authority in which the power to make, alter, repeal or amend 
the same vests under the law. 
16 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
17. 
 Clause (2) of Article 270-AA as amended by the Constitution 
(Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  is  of  a  pattern  of  a  curative  or 
validity  statute  and  must  be  understood  and  be  operative  in  that 
context.  Needless  to  observe  here  that  remedial  statute  is  one  which 
remedies  a  defect  in  the  common  law  or  in  the  pre-existing  body  of 
statute law. The legitimate purpose of remedial statute is to keep our 
system  of  our  jurisprudence  up-to-date. In  Black’s  Law  Dictionary, 
Sixth  Edition, page  1550, “validity  statute”  is stated to  be  “a  statute, 
purpose  of  which  is  to  cure  past  error  and  omission  and  thus  make 
valid what was invalid, but it grants no indulgence for the correction 
of future errors”. Since the defects in the legal measures when enacted 
during the period from 12th October, 1999 to 31st October, 2003 had to 
be  cured  so  as  to  avoid  instability  and  confusion  in  the  country, 
Article 270-AA (2) specifically provided subject to the provisions of 
the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  that  all  those 
laws  which  were  made  during  the  said  period  and  in  force  would 
continue  to  be  in  force  until  altered,  repealed  or  amended  by  the 
competent  authority.  It  means  that  the  legislature  owned  legal 
instruments  and  legal  measures  mentioned  in  clause  (2)  of  Article 
270-AA  and  made  between  the  specified  dates,  which  for  sure 
included  the  NAO,  1999,  as  if  enacted  by  itself  so  as  to  give  them 
validity  and  competency  and  while  adopting  the  principle  of 
ratification  such  validity  and  competency  was  performed.  In  fact  the 
doctrine of adoption propounded by Hobbes in his Leviathan, that the 
“Legislature  is  he,  not  by  whose  authority  the  laws  were  first  made, 
but  by  whose  authority  they  continue  to  be  laws”  is  thus  found 
embodied  in  Article  270-AA(2)  of  the  Constitution,  securing  the 
continuation in force of the laws including the NAO, 1999. 
  
18. 
   Now the stage is set to address the arguments canvassed at the 
Bar.  It  is  contended  that  the  NAO  ,1999  had  lapsed  inasmuch  as  it 
was  not  placed  before  the  competent  legislature  for  approval  in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 89 of the Constitution; and, 
that  though  on  the  date  of  promulgation  of  the  NAO,1999,  the 
17 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
Constitution was in abeyance, it was necessary to have the approval of 
the competent legislature within the period prescribed in Article 89 in 
order to continue the NAO, 1999 as valid law after the promulgation 
of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010.  These 
arguments  sans  merit  for  variety  of  reasons.  Firstly,  the  NAO  ,1999 
was  promulgated,  as  we  have  already  pointed  out,    long  before  the 
Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  came  into  force.  It 
was  therefore,  not  necessary  to  place  the  NAO,  1999  before  the 
competent 
legislature  for  approval.  This  Ordinance  has  been 
continued  as  a  valid  law  by  virtue  of  Article  270-AA  (2)  of  the 
Constitution  which  provides  that  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the 
Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  all  laws  including 
President’s  Orders,  Acts,  Ordinances,  Chief  Executive’s  Orders, 
enactments,  etc.  made  between  12th  October,  1999  and  31st  October, 
2003  and  still  in  force  shall  continue  to  be  in  force  until  altered, 
repealed  or  amended  by  the  competent  authority.    There  is  no  doubt 
that  the  NAO,  1999  was  a  valid  law  before  the  Constitution 
(Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  came  into  force  and  since  the 
NAO, 1999 had not been excluded in Article 270-AA (2) it continues 
to remain in force and its continuance was not  upon compliance with 
the  provisions of Article 89 of the Constitution.  Secondly, the word 
“until”  in  Article  270-AA  (2)  is  not  used  entirely  to  connote  a 
duration. It really means that existing laws including the NAO, 1999 
are to continue so long as they are not altered, repealed or amended. 
This finds support from the case of “United Provinces v. Mt. Atiqa 
Begum  and  others”  (A.I.R  1941  F.C.  16).  And  lastly,  during  the 
period  between  12th  October,  1999  and  31st  October,  2003,  the 
Constitution  was  in  abeyance  and,  therefore,  the  power  to  enact  the 
legal  measures  which  was  derived  from  the  Proclamation  of 
Emergency  dated  14th  October,  1999,  the  PCO  No.1  of  1999  and 
PCO  No.9  of  1999  was  without  any  limitation  as  to  the  time  and 
subject of legislation. Thus, there was no occasion for any conflict of 
the  legal  measures  in  the  state  of  things  then  existing  with  any 
provision  of  the  Constitution.    While  promulgating  the  Constitution 
18 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
(Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010  the  legislature  was  conscious  of 
above  facts  and  the  time  limitation  prescribed  in  Article  89  of  the 
Constitution  and  thus  by  virtue  of  Clause  (2)  of  Article  270-AA  it 
adopted  the  laws  including  the  NAO,  1999  made  during  the  said 
period  “subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth 
Amendment)  Act,  2010”.  The  expression  “subject  to”  conveys  the 
idea  of  a  provision  yielding  place  to  another  provision  or  other 
provisions  to  which  it  is  made  subject.  The  words  “subject  to  the 
provisions  of  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010,” 
therefore, mean that if there is irreconcilable conflict between the pre-
existing  law  and  a  provision  or  provisions  of  the  Constitution 
(Eighteenths  Amendment)  Act,  2010,  the  latter  shall  prevail  to  the 
extent of that inconsistency. Neither the provisions of the Constitution 
(Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 prescribe any condition to lay the 
Ordinances  (including  the  NAO,  1999)  within  120  days  before  the 
competent  legislature  for  approval  nor  there  is  any  conflict  between 
the  provisions  of  the  NAO,  1999  and  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth 
Amendment)  Act,  2010.  Since  Clause  (2)  of  Article  270-AA  is  not 
subject to the provisions of Article 89 of the Constitution, it cannot be 
held that the NAO, 1999 has ceased to be a law and is non-existent for 
non-compliance  of  the  limitation  suggested  in  Article  89  of  the 
Constitution  which  being  general  provisions  are  not  intended  to  be 
interfered  with  the  special  provisions  of  Article  270-AA(2)  of  the 
Constitution.   
 
19.  The reasons expounded above by us find fortification from the 
judgments  passed  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 
different cases. The First judgment on the subject was rendered in the 
case of “Badrul Haque Khan v. (1) The Election Tribunal, Dacca 
(2)  The  Chief  Election  Commissioner  and  (3)  Jamalus  Sattar” 
(PLD  1963  Supreme  Court  704).  In  this  case  it  was  held  that 
carrying over of laws as effective instruments from the period prior to 
the Revolution into the period of Martial Law was effected by Article 
4  of  the  Laws  (Continuance  in  Force)  Order,  1958,  and  it  was  clear 
19 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
that  within  the term  of  that  Article, the  Representation of  the People 
Act was one of the law which continued to be existing law after the 7th 
October,  1958.  The  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  did  not  find  that  the 
law  could  be  thought  to  have  been  deprived  of  its  force  by  anything 
appearing in the Proclamation of Martial Law of 7th October, 1958. 
The  second  judgment  was  rendered  in  the  case  of  “Malik 
Muzaffar Khan v. Government of the Punjab and 2 others” (1980 
SCMR  121).  In  that  case  the  validity  and  existence  of  the  West 
Pakistan  Tribunal  of 
Inquiry  Ordinance  1969  was  under 
consideration. It was pleaded that with the issuance of “Proclamation 
of  withdrawal  of  Martial  Law”  on  21st  April,  1972  the  said  law  had 
lapsed  automatically.  This  argument  was  repelled  in  the  following 
words:- 
that  even 
―The  next  point  argued  was 
though 
Ordinance  II  of  1969  was  promulgated  during  the  Martial 
Law  of  General  Agha  Muhammad  Yaha  Khan  but  as  in  its 
very nature it was an ―Ordinance‖ therefore according to the 
very  concept  of  that  type  of  legislation  such  an  Ordinance 
lapsed  within  six  weeks  of  the  next  session  of  the  Provincial 
Assembly under Article 135(2) of the Interim Constitution and 
thereafter  it  ceased  to  remain  operative  in  any  form.  The 
contention  has  no  force.  The  aforesaid  Article  applied  to 
Ordinances  made  after  the  promulgation  of  the  Interim 
Constitution whereas for the continuation of existing law ( i.e. 
existing on 21st April, 1972 as was the present Ordinance) the 
relevant provision is Article 280(1) which stated that ―Except 
as provided by this Article, all existing laws shall, subject to 
this Constitution,  continue  in force,  so  far as  applicable  and 
with  the  necessary  adaptations,  until  altered,  repealed  or 
mended by the appropriate Legislature‖. As it is not the case 
of  the  petitioner  that  the  aforesaid  Ordinance  has  been 
repealed therefore the  plea raised fails. For the meanings of 
word  ―until‖  see  Hashmat  Ali  v.  Abdul  Karim  and  another 
(1)  where with reference to corresponding Article 225 (1) of 
1962 Constitution and section 292 of the Government of India 
Act, 1935, it was laid down that when used with reference to 
authorizing  continuation  of  the  old  laws  for  example  by 
saying  ―until‖  altered,  repealed  or  amended,  this  word 
connotes  and  means  that  ―so  long  as‖  they  are  not  altered, 
repealed or amended they would continue  in operation, and 
from  that  point  of  view,  if  we  can  say  so  such  a  provision 
gives  a  new  sanction  for  the  continuation  of  such  laws  as 
aforesaid.  At  this  place  it  may  further  be  pointed  out  that 
Article  270  (1)  of  1973  Constitution  provided  a  new  scheme 
for validating laws passed between 25th March, 1969 and 19th 
December,  1971  (the  period  of  Martial  of  General  Agha 
Muhammad  Yahya  Khan)—authorizing  the  Parliament  to 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
20 
validate  them.  Consequently  the  Parliament  passed  a  law 
known as the ―validation of Laws Act LXIII of 1975‖ gazetted 
on  29th  July,  1975.  Section  2  whereof  laid  down  that  ―the 
laws  mentioned  in  the  schedule  are  hereby  declared  to  have 
been validly made by a competent authority‖. The Ordinance 
in question figures at serial No.1 of head ―v—West Pakistan 
Ordinances‖. This is to be read with Article 268 (1) of 1973 
Constitution  which  is  similarly  worded  as  Article  280  of  the 
Interim  Constitution  and  sanctions  continuation  of  ―existing 
laws‖ onward from the commencing day namely 14th August, 
1973.  In  this  way  the  Ordinance  in  question  which  was  an 
―existing  law‖  at  the  time  of  the  Interim  Constitution, 
continued  to  remain  an  ―existing  law‖  at  the  time  of  the 
promulgation  of  1973  Constitution,  and  then  was  authorized 
to  continue  further  thereunder,  and  was  also  validated  as 
hereinbefore  mentioned.  There  was  thus  no  break  in  the 
continuity of this Ordinance from the date of its promulgation 
and  it  still  continues  to  remain  a  valid  law  of  the  land  as 
explained above.‖ 
 
 
Somewhat similar proposition came  under consideration in the 
case  of  “Sally  Textile  Mills  Limited  vs.  Collector  of  Customs, 
Customs  House,  Karachi”  (1991  SCMR  721).  In  that  case  the 
Finance  Ordinance,  1982  was  challenged.  Paragraph  7  of  the  Laws 
(Continuance in Force) Order, 1977 dispensed with the requirement of 
limitation  as  to  its duration  so  far  as  the Ordinances  promulgated by 
the  President  or  a  Governor  of  Province  was  concerned.  This  law 
remained  in  force  by  virtue  of  Article  270-A  of  the  Constitution.  It 
was contended that the Article 270-A of the Constitution had a limited 
efficacy of placing beyond dispute the competence and the validity of 
legislative instruments specified in that provision and that they did not 
accomplish anything beyond; that the law which continued to remain 
in force had to satisfy an additional test and that was of its consistency 
with  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  as  revived;  and,  that    the 
removal  of  the  limitation  or  duration  of  the  validity  of  Ordinance 
came to an end with the revival of the duration w.e.f. 25.03.1981 and 
thus Finance Ordinance 1982 could not be considered to be good law 
after  four  months  of  its  promulgation    without  having  received  the 
approval of the Parliament. The above noted arguments were repelled 
and it was held in the following terms. 
―So far as the contention with regard to Article 270-A 
of the Constitution is concerned, the object was never to take 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
21 
it beyond the curing of the competency and the validity of the 
legislative instruments specified therein. It is also correct that 
for  laws  which  are  to  continue  after  the  revival  of  the 
Constitution  have  to  conform  to  the  other  Constitutional 
Provisions  and  must  satisfy  that  test.  However,  on  the 
strength  of such an interpretation of Article  270-A, it cannot 
be said that on revival of Article 89 of the Constitution by the 
Provisional  Constitution  Order,  1981,  such  a  contrariety 
came  into  existence,  as  to  repeal  paragraph  7  of  the 
Proclamation  Order  of  1977  dispensing  with  the  limitation 
with  regard  to  the  duration  of  the  validity  of  the  Ordinance. 
The Provisional Constitution Order, 1981 did not accomplish 
even by implication the repeal or displacement of paragraph 
7  of  the  Proclamation  Order.  The  two  could  subsist  as  they 
did when the Proclamation itself was made. If Article 89 had 
not been in the field or is not in the field paragraph 7 of the 
Proclamation  Order  would  not  be  necessary  and  merely 
because  Article  89  is  revived,  it  cannot  be  argued  that  it 
became  unnecessary  or  got  repealed  impliedly.  The  two  are 
made  to  co-exist,  paragraph  7  modifying  or  controlling 
Article  89.  Paragraph  7  of  the  Proclamation  Order  cannot 
exist unless Article 89 is in the field. Besides, on no principle 
of constitutional interpretation it can be said that the revival 
of  the  Constitution  had  the  effect  of  the  reviving  something 
which was not in existence  immediately  before  the  revival  of 
the  Constitution, 
i.e.  need  of  placing  an  Ordinance 
promulgated before the revival of the Constitution before the 
Assembly within four  months of its promulgation after which 
period  it  ceased  to  have  effect.    Such  revival  of  the 
Constitution  certainly  will  prospectively  bring  to  life  such 
requirement  but  would  not  revive  for  past  matters  the 
requirement  which  was  not  in  existence  immediately  before 
the revival of the Constitution. Such a result is sustainable on 
the strength of Article 264 of the Constitution.‖  
  
 
The  last  judgment  which  clinches  the  controversy  involved  in 
this  case  was  referred  by  Mr.  Imran  Aziz  Khan,  learned  Deputy 
Attorney  General  of  Pakistan.  This  is  the  judgment  which  was 
rendered  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  the  case  of 
“Justice Hasnat Ahmed Khan and 3 others v. Registrar, Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  and  others”  (PLD  2010  Supreme  Court  806). 
The question for determination in that case was whether the Contempt 
of Court Act, 1976 or the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003 was the 
law  in  force  regarding  the  contempt  proceedings.  It  is  pertinent  to 
mention  here 
that  Contempt  of  Court  Ordinance,  2003  was 
promulgated  during  the  period  12th  October,  1999  and  31st  October, 
2003,  that  is,  the  period  during  which  the  NAO,  1999  was 
22 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
promulgated.  The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  taking  into 
consideration the effect of the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 
2003  and  the  Constitution  (Eighteenth  Amendment)  Act,  2010 
declared  that  the  Contempt  of  Court  Ordinance  as  permanent 
legislation. The relevant extract of the judgment reads as under:- 
its  protection.  The  Constitution 
 ―(10) It would be seen that the contempt of Court Act, 1976 
has  been  repealed  effectively  by  all 
three  successive 
Ordinances.  Furthermore  Article  270-AA  substituted  by 
Constitution  (17th  Amendment)  Act,  2003  has  accorded 
permanence to the Ordinances issued prior to 31st December, 
2003.  Ordinance  V  of  2003  issued  on  15th  December,  2003 
(18th 
comes  under 
Amendment)  Act,  2010  again  substituted  Article  270-AA  and 
while    declaring    unlawful  a  number  of  instruments  issued 
during  the military rule, nevertheless,  by Clause 2 accorded 
permanence to,  inter alia,  Ordinances promulgated between 
12th  October,  1999  and  31st  December,  2003.We  are, 
therefore,    left  in  no  doubt    that  the  Ordinance  V  of  2003, 
being 
  permanent  legislation  and  having  repealed  the 
Contempt  of  Court  Act,  1976,  is  the  law  regulating  the 
proceedings of contempt of Court.‖  
 
20.  The  above  cited  judgment  was  challenged  in  the  Intra  Court 
Appeal  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  and  the  same 
was  upheld  through  the  judgment  which  is  reported  as  “Justice 
Hasnat Ahmad Khan and others V. Federation of Pakistan/State” 
(PLD 2011 Supreme Court 680).  
21.  On  the  basis  of  aforesaid  survey  of  case  law,  the  irresistible 
conclusion is that the NAO, 1999 has attained the status of permanent 
law by virtue of the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010.  
22.  Lastly,  we  examine  the  point  as  to  whether  on  the  basis  of 
principle settled in the case of “Sindh High Court Bar Association 
through  its  Secretary  and  another  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan 
through  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,  Islamabad  and 
others”  (PLD  2009  Supreme  Court,  879),  the  NAO,1999  can  be 
declared  to  be  a  dead  letter.  As  stated  above,  the  challenge  in  Sindh 
High  Court  Bar  Association’s  case  was  to  the  validity  of  the 
Proclamation  of  Emergency,  the  Provisional  Constitutional  Order 
No.1 of 2007, Oath Order, 2007, and the laws made during the period 
w.e.f.  3rd  November,  2007  to  15th  December,  2007.  Since  the  said 
23 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
instruments  were  not  approved  or  validated  by  the  Parliament,  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  examined  their  validity  and 
declared to have been passed without lawful authority and of no legal 
effect. After doing this, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan went 
further to determine the fate of the laws which were made during the 
said period.  In order to avoid any chaos, confusion and instability in 
the  country  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  neither  applied 
the  doctrine  of  condonation  nor  doctrine  of  de  facto  but  left  the 
question of validation of Ordinances to be decided by the Parliament 
or certain Provincial Assemblies within the period of 120 days in term 
of  Article  89  and  128  of  the  Constitution.  This  was  in  line  with  the 
principle settled in the Watan Party’s case. On the contrary the NAO, 
1999  which was made in pursuance of PCO No.1 of 1999 read with 
PCO No.9 of 1999 was affirmed, adopted and declared to have been 
validly  made  by  the  legislature  firstly  through  the  Constitution 
(Seventeenth Amendment) Act 2003 and subsequently stood validated 
by the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, it means that 
the  NAO,  1999    was  made  a  permanent  law  and  thus  it  was  not 
required to be  laid  before the  Parliament for  its  approval in terms  of 
Article  89  of  the  Constitution  and  principle  settled  in  Sindh  High 
Court Bar Association’s case. 
23.  Learned  counsels  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  petitioners  also 
argued  before  us  the  plea  of  mala  fide,  violation  of  the  provision  of 
Rules of  Business, 1973 of  the  Federal  Government  and  violation  of 
principle  settled  in  the  case  of  “Messrs  Mustafa  Impex,  Karachi 
and  others  v.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  through  Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad  and  others”  (PLD  2016  Supreme  Court  808) 
with  the  request  that  since  the  NAO,  1999  is  not  a  valid  piece  of 
legislation, it be struck down. We are afraid that this argument cannot 
be  entertained  for  the  simple  reason  that  validity  of  the  NAO,  1999 
has already been determined in the case of  “Khan Asfand Yar Wali 
and  others  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  through  Cabinet  Division 
Islamabad  and  others”  (PLD  2001  Supreme  607).  The  said 
judgment  neither  can  be  reviewed  by  this  Court  nor  validity  of  the 
W.P. No.196881 of 2018 
 
NAO, 1999 can be examined on any new plea on the principle of res 
24 
judicata. 
24.  After giving  anxious  consideration to the contentions  raised in 
this case, we are satisfied that for the  foregoing reasons  the National 
Accountability  Ordinance,  1999  still  exists  and  is  in  force  and  thus 
this petition along with connected petitions merits dismissal and these 
are, accordingly dismissed.
