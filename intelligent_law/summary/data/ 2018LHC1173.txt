JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing:  29.05.2018 
 
Petitioner(s) by:  M/s  Muhammad  Azam  Zafar  Khan, 
Muhammad  Rizwan  Rasheed  and  Sheikh 
Muhammad Yar Zahoor, Advocates 
 
Respondent(s) by:  Ch. Imtiaz Ullah Khan, Advocate for the 
respondent No.2 
 
 
SHAHID  BILAL  HASSAN-J:  Succinctly,  the  petitioner  got 
married  with  respondent  No.2  on  06.05.2011,  out  of  the  said 
wedlock  a  male  child  namely  Muhammad  Danial  was  born  on 
11.02.2012.  Due  to  strained  relations  between  the  petitioner  and 
respondent  No.2  divorce  occurred  with  mutual  understanding  on 
23.04.2012  vide  an  agreement.  The  respondent  No.2  contracted 
second  marriage  with  Muhammad  Ikhalq  on  21.06.2013. 
Allegedly,  the  respondent  No.1  filed  an  application  for  his 
appointment  as  guardian  of  the  minor  namely  Danial  on 
21.09.2015,  in  which  he  categorically  stated  that  the  minor  has 
been  residing  with  him  since  his  birth  and  this  fact  has  been 
admitted by respondent No.2 by appearing in the witness box on 
09.10.2015  in  that  application.  The  petitioner  submitted  his 
detailed  reply  to  the  said  guardian  petition.  Apart  from  this,  the 
petitioner filed a guardian petition  on 14.11.2015 for the custody 
of his son Danial under section 25 of the Guardian & Wards Act, 
1890  alongwith  petition  under  section  12  of  the  Act.  The 
W.P.No.67546 of 2017 
2 
respondents  No.1  &  2  submitted  their  written  replies  to  the  said 
petitions.  The  respondent  No.2  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of 
maintenance,  dower  amount  and  dowry  articles  against  the 
petitioner  on  11.05.2016.  The  petitioner  submitted  his  written 
statement  to  the  said  suit.  After  failure  of  pre-trial  reconciliation 
proceedings,  the  learned  trial  Court  consolidated  that  suit  and 
guardian  petition  filed  by  the  petitioner  and  framed  consolidated 
issues  on  29.05.2017.  The  learned  trial  Court  dismissed  the 
application under section 12 of the Act vide impugned order dated 
12.06.2017, however, allowed the petitioner to meet his son only 
twice in a month on second and forth Saturday of every month in 
the  Court  premises  subject  to  payment  of  travelling  charges 
Rs.300/-.  Being  dissatisfied  the  petitioner  has  filed  the  instant 
constitutional petition. 
2. 
 
Learned  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of 
the 
respondent  No.2  has  challenged  the  maintainability  of  the 
constitutional  petition  in  hand  and  has  argued  that  against  order 
passed  on  an  application  under  section  12  of  the  Guardian  & 
Wards  Act,  1890,  appeal  lies  under  section  14(1)(b)  of  the  West 
Pakistan Family Courts, Act, 1964 before the District Judge when 
the order is passed by the Judge Family Court, because expression 
‘a  decision  given’  in  section  14  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964 
does  not,  in  any  manner,  qualify  by  any  such  word  as  ‘final’. 
Thus, he has prayed for dismissal of the constitutional petition in 
hand.  Reliance  has  been  placed  on  Syed  Shamim  Ahmad  v.  Mst. 
Riaz Fatima PLD 1975 Karachi 448, Mst. Akbar Jan v. Mst. Bibi 
Nasim and 4 others 2000 YLR 2652-Peshawar, Abdul Majeed v. 
Additional  District  Judge,  Talagang  and  2  others  2009  CLC 
1143-Lahore,  Memoona  Ilyas  v.  Additional  District  Judge  and 
others 2017 CLC 1747-Lahore and Mst. Eram Raza and 2 others 
v.  Syed  Mutaqi  Muhammad  Ali  and  another  2018  MLD  727-
Sindh.

3. 
 
In  response  to  the  attack  on  maintainability  of  the 
constitutional  petition,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 
argued that the word ‘decision’ used in section 14 of the Act is to 
be read in the garb of ‘decree’ and interlocutory order passed by 
the  Family Judge  is not  appealable  and only writ  lies  against  the 
same,  therefore,  the  instant  constitutional  petition  is  competent 
and maintainable. Relies on Syed Muhammad Raza Shah v. Syeda 
Salma Gilani and another PLD 1976 Lahore 1015, S. Azhar-Ul-
Hassan Naqvi v. Mst. Hamida Bibi and 2 others 1979 CLC 754-
Lahore, Syed Maqsood Ali v. mst. Soofia Noushaba and 2 others 
1986 CLC 620-Karachi, Mst. Mahan Shabbir v. Salman Haider 
and  others  2014  CLC  330-Islamabad  and  Maliha  Hussain  v. 
Additional  District  Judge-V  and  another  2017  MLD  485-Sindh. 
Thus,  he  has,  while  reiterating  the  grounds  urged  in  the 
memorandum of the constitutional petition, prayed for acceptance 
of  the  same,  setting  of  the  impugned  order  and  handing  over 
interim custody of the minor son Danial to him.

Heard. 
With regard to a non-appealable order, a full Bench 
of the Apex Court of the country in a case reported as Syed Saghir 
Ahmed  Naqvi  v.  Province  of  Sindh  through  Chief  Secretary  and 
another (1996 SCMR 1165) has held:- 
The  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
appellant  that  where  appeal  lies  only  against  the 
final  order  a  Constitution  petition  challenging  the 
interim  orders  can  yet  be  maintained  is  erroneous. 
In  the  Lahore  case  PLD  1990  Lah. 352  relied upon 
by the learned counsel for the appellant itself where 
a final order was passed pending proceedings in the 
Constitutional 
jurisdiction 
it  was  held 
that 
jurisdiction stood barred final order having come in 
the field. 
W.P.No.67546 of 2017 
4 
It was further held:- 
The  statute  excluding  a  right  of  appeal  from  the 
interim  order  cannot  be  passed  by  bringing  under 
attack  such 
interim  orders 
in  Constitutional 
jurisdiction.  The  party  affected  has  to  wait  till  it 
matures into a final order and then to attack it in the 
proper  exclusive  forum  created  for  the  purpose  of 
examining such orders. 
Similar  view was  adopted  in  a  case reported  as  Mumtaz Hussain 
alias  Butta  v.  Chief  Administrator of  Auqaf,  Punjab,  Lahore and 
another  (1976  SCMR  450)  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan, wherein it was invariably held:- 
As  the  said  Ordinance  has  taken  away  the  right  of 
petitioner 
to 
interim 
relief, 
learned  counsel 
submitted  that  this  was  a  ground  which  entitled  the 
petitioner  to  prosecute  a  writ  petition  despite  the 
pendency  of  the  proceedings  on  the  District  Court. 
The  argument  is  misconceived  because  the  writ 
jurisdiction of the superior Courts cannot be invoked 
in aid of injustice and in order to defeat the express 
provisions of the statutory law. 
6. 
 
The interim order passed in the instant case is under 
section 12 of the Guardian & Wards Act, 1890 and now it is to be 
seen whether the same is appealable or not. The learned Guardian 
Judge partially allowed the application and the petitioner has been 
allowed to meet his son namely Danial only twice in a month on 
second and forth Saturday of every month in the Court premises. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has stressed upon filing of 
the constitution petition on the ground that the impugned order is 
not appealable as the matters pertaining to the guardianship issues 
shall  be  governed  by  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  and  under 
section  14(3)  there  is a  restraint upon  filing  an  appeal  against  an 
W.P.No.67546 of 2017 
5 
interim  order.  No  doubt  ,  order  passed  under  section  12  of  the 
Guardian &  Wards  Act,  1890  is  not  mentioned  under  appealable 
orders  as  provided  within  section  47  of  the  Act,  1890  but  after 
insertion  of  the  word  “Guardianship”  in  the  First  Schedule  of 
Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  the  provision  of  appeal  is  available 
against  an  order  under  section  12  of  the  Act,  1890  before  the 
District Judge or Additional District Judge as per the provision of 
Section  14  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964.  In  actual,  the 
provisions  of  Guardian  &  Wards  Act  cannot  be  read  in  isolation 
after  bringing  the  matter  pertaining  to  ‘guardianship’  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Family  Courts  by  the  Legislature.  All  the 
matters,  now,  pertaining  to  guardianship  shall  be  exclusively 
triable by the Family Courts created under the Family Courts Act, 
1964, which is a later enactment comparing to Guardian & Wards 
Act, 1890, because it is the settled principle of interpretation that 
the  statute  later  in  time  shall  prevail  to  the  earlier;  reliance  is 
placed on Aley Nabi and others v. Chairman, Sindh Labour Court 
and  another (1993 SCMR  328),  Messrs Mehraj Flour Mills  and 
others v. Provincial Government and others (2001 SCMR 1806) 
and Suo Motu Case No.13 of 2007 (PLD 2008 SC 217). 
7. 
 
So  far  as  the  argument  that  section  14(3)  of  the 
Family  Court  Act,  1964  bars  appeal  before  the  District  Court  in 
the matter in hand is concerned, plain reading of the language of 
section  14  of  the  Act,  1964  makes  it  vivid  that  notwithstanding 
anything  provided  in  any  other  law  for  the  time  being  enforce  a 
decision given or a decree shall be appealable. The only exclusion 
is with regard to an interim order. While dealing with the similar 
situation earlier it was pronounced that such like order falls within 
the purview of ‘decision given’ and is appealable under section 14 
of  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964.  In  this  regard 
reliance  is placed  on  Mst.  Zaibun  Nisa  v. Muhammad  Mozammil 
PLD  1972  Karachi  410,  Syed  Shamim  Ahmad  v.  Mst.  Riaz 
W.P.No.67546 of 2017 
6 
Fatima  PLD  1975  Karachi  448,  Mst.  Akbar  Jan  v.  Mst.  Bibi 
Nasim and  4 others  2000 YLR  2652-Peshawar,  Memoona  Ilyas 
v.  Additional District Judge  and others 2017 CLC 1747-Lahore 
and Mst. Eram Raza and 2 others v. Syed Mutaqi Muhammad Ali 
and another 2018 MLD 727-Sindh. 
8. 
 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  is  much  clear  on  the 
subject  that  the  impugned  order  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 
Family  Court  is  appealable  before  the  District  Court;  therefore, 
the  same  cannot  be  called  into  question  in  a  constitutional 
petition. Be that as it may, I hold my hand back from entering into 
any  discussion  on  merits  of  the  case,  may  it  prejudice  case  of 
either side, because after disposal of an application under section 
12  of  the  Act,  1890  any  of  the  parties  of  a  guardianship 
proceedings  may  resort  to  move  another  application  and  such 
practice is not contrary to law as well as principle of res judicata, 
because  orders  with  regard  to  interim  custody  of  the  minors  are 
tentative  and  with  the  material  changes  in  the  situations,  the 
Guardian  Court  can  always  be  moved  for  modification  of  the 
orders so as to uphold welfare of the minors. 
9. 
 
The case law relied upon by the learned counsel for 
the petitioner, with utmost respect to the same, has no relevance to 
the  peculiar  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  in  hand;  thus,  it 
does not render any assistance or help to the petitioner’s case. 
10. 
 
In  view  of  the  above  discussion  and  while  placing 
reliance  on  the  judgments  supra,  the  constitutional  petition  in 
hand stands dismissed.  
11. 
 
Before  parting  with  this  judgment,  it  is,  however, 
observed  that  the  petitioner  may  prefer  appeal  against  the 
impugned  order before  the  learned  appellate  Court,  if  so  advised 
and desired, which shall be decided on merits in accordance with 
law  or  may  repeat  application  under  section  12  of  the  Act,  1890 
because such practice is not contrary to law as well as principle of 
W.P.No.67546 of 2017 
7 
res judicata as interim orders relating to the custody of the minors 
are  tentative  and  with  the  material  change  in  the  circumstances, 
the  Guardian  Court  can  always  be  moved  for  modification  of 
orders to promote the minors welfare. No order as to the costs.
