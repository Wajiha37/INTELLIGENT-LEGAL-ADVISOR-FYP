28.09.2018  Mr. Asif Mehmood Pirzada, Advocate for appellant.      
 
 
Through  this  appeal,  the  appellant/surety  has 
 
 
called  in  question  order  dated  27.09.2017  passed  by 
executing  court  whereby  his  property  was  ordered  to  be 
auctioned  in  execution  of  decree  passed  in  a    suit  for 
recovery  of  Rs.5,00,000/- 
filed  by  Muhammad 
Tariq/respondent  No.1/decree  holder  against  Ehsan 
Elahi/respondent  No.2/judgment  debtor  for  whom  the 
appellant  stood  as  surety  and  has  further  called  in 
question  the  order  dated  26.06.2018  passed  by  ADJ, 
Chishtian  whereby  the  appeal/revision  filed  by  the 
appellant against the said order was dismissed.   
2. 
The  brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the  suit  titled 
“Muhammad  Tariq  vs.  Ehsan  Elahi”  was  decreed  on 
23.11.2016  in  favour  of  Muhammad  Tariq/respondent 
No.1, whereafter in the execution petition on 22.06.2017, 
the  executing  court  issued  warrants  of  attachment  of 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.  
2 
appellant’s  property  and  on  27.09.2017  ordered  to 
auction  the  property  of  the  present  appellant  who  on 
19.05.2017  stood  as  surety  of  the  judgment  debtor  in 
execution  proceedings  of  the  aforesaid  decree.    Feeling 
aggrieved of the said order, the appellant filed a revision 
petition/appeal  which  was  dismissed  vide  order  dated 
26.06.2018.  Both 
the  aforesaid  orders  are  under 
challenge  through  instant  appeal  on  the  ground  that  the 
appellant  has  not  been  provided  proper  opportunity  to 
defend his case.  
3. 
From  perusal  of  record,  it  is  seen  that  the  decree 
amounting  to  Rs.5,00,000/-  was  passed  in  the  recovery 
suit  against  respondent  No.2  who  was  arrested  in 
execution 
thereof  and  produced 
in 
the  court  on 
19.05.2017  where  the  judgment  debtor/respondent  No.2 
deposited  Rs.1,00,000/-  and  agreed  to  deposit  the 
remaining  outstanding  amount  in  four  equal  monthly 
installments and the present appellant stood as surety for 
the  payment  of  the  said  installments  and  case  was 
adjourned to 22.06.2017.  However, the judgment debtor 
and the present appellant failed to abide by the said terms 
and  conditions  fixed  on  19.05.2017,  where-after  vide 
order dated 22.06.2017 the court issued warrants of arrest 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.  
3 
of  the  judgment  debtor  and  warrants  of  attachment  of 
property  against 
the  appellant. 
  Subsequently,  on 
27.09.2017  the  learned  executing  court  attached  the 
property of the appellant for the purpose of satisfaction of 
the  decree  and  appointed  Naib  Tehsildar,  Halqa 
Chishtian as court auctioneer.  The said order was called 
in  question  by  the  appellant  by  filing  a  revision 
petition/appeal  which  was  dismissed  vide  order  dated 
26.06.2018. 
  The  appellant  has 
throughout 
the 
proceedings  in  all  courts  admitted  that  he  had  stood 
surety  for  the  judgment  debtor  and  the  said  judgment 
debtor  instead  of  complying  with  his  undertaking  to 
make payment of decretal amount in four equal monthly 
installments had disappeared from the court, where-after 
proceedings  have  been  initiated  against  the  appellant.  
The  appellant  has  called  in  question  the  order  of 
proceeding  against  him  by  attaching  his  property  and 
putting  the  same  to  auction  by  claiming  therein  that  the 
order had been passed without issuing any notice to him 
and,  therefore,  was  of  no  legal  effect.    A  surety  is 
proceeded  against  for  enforcement  of  his  liability  as 
provided under Section 145  of CPC which is reproduced 
below: 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.

“S.  145  Enforcement  of  liability  of  surety.—
Where any person has become liable as surety – 
a) 
for  the  performance  of  any  decree  or 
any part thereof, or  
b) 
for  the  restitution  of  any  property 
taken in execution of a decree, or 
c) 
for  the  payment  of  any  money,  or  for 
the  fulfillment  of  any  condition  imposed  on 
any  person,  under  an  order  of  the  Court  in 
any  suit  or  in  any  proceedings  consequent 
thereon,  
the decree  or order may be executed against him, 
to  the  extent  to  which  he  has  rendered  himself 
personally  liable,  in  the  manner  herein  provided 
for the execution of decrees, and such person shall, 
for  the  purposes  of  appeal,  be  deemed  a  party 
within the meaning of Section 47: 
Provided  that  such  notice  as  the  Court  in 
each case thinks sufficient has been given to 
the surety.”     
 
The perusal of the record shows that on the day when the 
appellant stood as surety on 19.05.2017, he had agreed to 
make payment of monthly installments in case of failure 
of judgment debtor to do so and had sufficient notice that 
on the due dates he was liable to make payment in default 
on  the  part  of  the  judgment  debtor.    At  the  most,  the 
appellant  was  entitled  to  receive  notice  from  the  court 
which  in  the  opinion  of  the  court  is  sufficient  for 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.  
5 
proceeding  against  the  surety  in  terms  of  section  145 
CPC.    Vide  order  dated  22.06.2017,  the  executing  court 
issued warrants for attachment of the appellant’s property 
which  also  amounted  to  notice  to  the  appellant  in  terms 
of  Section  145  of  the  CPC  where-after  on  non-
appearance of the judgment debtor as well as the surety, 
the  court  proceeded  to  attach  appellant’s  property  and 
initiated proceedings for its auction for satisfaction of the 
decree.   Before the said property could be put to auction, 
the  appellant  challenged  the  order  by  filing  a  revision 
petition/appeal before the appellate court where stay was 
granted  and  the  matter  remained  pending  for  about  nine 
months  and  during  said  period,  the  appellant  remained 
unable  to  persuade  the  judgment  debtor  to  satisfy  the 
decree.  In the said court, the appellant had admitted that 
he  had  stood  as  surety  of  the  judgment  debtor.    Proper 
opportunity  of  hearing  was  provided  to  him  before 
dismissal of his revision/appeal.   
4. 
Although  the  appellant  claims  that  notice  was  not 
served  upon  him  by  the  executing  court  but  in  his 
revision,  where  the  matter  remained  pending  for  about 
nine months, sufficient opportunities of hearing had been 
provided to the  appellant  to  defend himself  and  produce 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.  
6 
judgment  debtor  for satisfaction  of the  decree  or in  case 
of default clear the outstanding liability but the appellant 
did  not  make  any  effort  to  abide  by  his  aforesaid 
undertaking.    The  revisional  court  provided  sufficient 
opportunities  of  hearing  to  the  appellant  to  establish  his 
case,  therefore,  even  if  the  earlier  order  was  passed  by 
the executing court could be treated to be without notice 
or  hearing,  the  said  defect,  if  any,  stands  cured  by  the 
hearing provided by the revisional court and also by this 
Court.  Reliance in this regard is placed on Muhammad 
Rafiq  and  others  vs.  Ralley  Khan  through  legal  heirs 
(1989  MLD  3823)  wherein  it  has  been  provided  that  if 
non-service  of  a  notice  only,  would  constitute  violation 
of  principles  of  natural  justice,  hearing  in  appeal  or 
revision  would  operate  to  cure  that  defect.    Even 
otherwise,  appellant  is  bound  by  his  undertaking  given 
before the court whereby he stood as surety for payment 
in  case  of  judgment  debtor’s  default.    Moreover,  the 
liability  of  the  surety  is  coextensive  with  that  of  the 
judgment  debtor  unless  it  is  otherwise  provided  by  the 
contract, as provided in Section 128 of the Contract Act, 
1872.  Reliance  in  this  regard  is  placed  on  Rafique 
Hazquel  Masih  vs. Bank  Alfalah  Ltd  and  others  (2005 
EFA No.13 of 2018/BWP  
Dated 28.09.2018.  
7 
SCMR  72),    Industrial  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan 
vs. Hyderabad  Beverage  Company  Private  Limited  and 
others  (2016  SCMR  451)  and  Messrs  Platinum 
Insurance  Company  Limited,  Karachi 
through 
Managing  Director 
vs.  Daewoo  Corporation, 
Shaikhupura  through  Director,  Administration  and 
Finance  (PLD  1999  S.C.  01).    In  the  present  case,  the 
appellant has failed to establish that the said liability has 
been discharged.   Besides, no prejudice has been caused 
to  the  appellant  as  he  was  fully  aware  of  his  duty  to 
satisfy  the  decree  and  had  notice  of  proceedings  against 
him as is evident from the revision petition filed by him.  
No  misreading,  non-reading,  illegality  or  jurisdictional 
defect in the orders passed by the courts below is pointed 
out.   
5. 
Resultantly,  this  appeal  being  devoid  of  any  force 
is dismissed.
