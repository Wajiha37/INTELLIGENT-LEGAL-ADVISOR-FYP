AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through  this  writ  petition 
the  petitioner,  who  is  plaintiff  of  a  suit  for  declaration,  has 
challenged the judgment dated 03.06.2017 passed by the learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  Sheikhupura  whereby  a  revision 
petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed and the order dated 
17.02.2016  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  1st  Class, 
Sheikhupura  whereby  the  review  petition  against  order  dated 
29.09.2015 was dismissed and the order dated 29.09.2015 passed 
by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  1st  Class,  Sheikhupura  whereby  an 
application  moved  by  the  defendants/respondents  No.6  and  6-A 
under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC was accepted and plaint was 
returned to present before the proper forum.

In  a  suit  filed  on  23.07.2012  the  plaintiff/petitioner 
challenged registered sale deeds No.1275 and 1277 registered on 
W.P.No.64308 of 2017. 
2 
22.04.2006  with  regard  to  the  land  fully  described  in  the  plaint. 
The  registered  sale  deeds  are  on  behalf  of  plaintiff  for  sale  of 
land  in  favour  of  defendants  No.1  and  2,  respectively.  The 
plaintiff  also  challenged  mutations  No.340  and  341  attested  on 
29.04.2006  on  the  basis  of  said  sale  deeds  and  mortgage  of  suit 
property by defendants No.1 and 2 with respondent No.3-A (The 
Bank of Punjab Tufail Road  Branch,  Lahore) through registered 
mortgage  deed  No.1753  registered  on  30.05.2006  for  securing 
the loan against mortgage of property.  
3. 
 
The  Bank  moved  an  application  under  Order  VII 
Rule  10  of  the  CPC  for  return  of  plaint  stating  that  Banking 
Court has exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and try the matter, as 
admittedly  the  property  was  mortgaged  with  the  Bank  against 
which loan has been advanced on the basis of mortgage. Learned 
trial  court  accepted  the  application  vide  order  dated  29.09.2015 
and  returned  the  plaint.  A  review  petition  was  filed  before  the 
learned trial court on 10.12.2015, which too was dismissed  vide 
order  dated  17.02.2016.  Thereafter  a  revision  petition  (Civil 
Revision  No.1805  of  2016)  was  preferred  before  this  Court, 
which  was  transmitted  to  the  learned  District  Judge  for  final 
hearing  after  enhancement  of  pecuniary  jurisdiction  of  learned 
District  Judge.  The  revision  was  dismissed  by  the  learned 
Additional  District  Judge,  Sheikhupura  vide  judgment  dated 
03.06.2017. Hence, this writ petition.  
W.P.No.64308 of 2017.

I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at 
full  length  and  also  gone  through  the  record  minutely  with  his 
able  assistance  as  well  as  the  case  law  i.e.  “AMTEX  LIMITED 
through  Director  versus  BANKISLAMI  PAKISTAN  LTD.  and  8 
others” 
(2016  CLD  2007),  “MARAHABA  PAKISTAN 
INTERNATIONAL  and  others  versus  HABIB  BANK  LIMITED 
and  another”  (2017  CLD  995),  “Messrs  SUMMIT  BANK 
LIMITED  through  Manager  versus  Messrs  QASIM  AND  CO. 
through Muhammad Alam and another” (2015 S C M R 1341), 
“KARACHI ELECTRIC PROVIDENT FUND versus NATIONAL 
INVESTMENT  (UNIT)  TRUST  and  others”  (2003  CLD  1026), 
“ABDUL  REHMAN  ALLANA  versus  CITIBANK”  (2003  CLD 
1843),  “LAHORE  BEVERAGE  COMPANY  (PVT.)  LIMITED 
through  Chief  Executive  versus  MUHAMMAD  JAVED  SHAFI 
and 2 others” (2008 CLC 759) and  “SYED ARIF SHAH versus 
ABDUL  HAKIM”  (PLD  1986  Karachi  189),  referred  to  by  the 
learned counsel for the petitioner.

The  respondents  have  been  proceeded  against  ex-
parte vide order dated 18.04.2018.  
6. 
 
I  agree  with  the  view  taken  by  the  learned  courts 
below  that  with  regard  to  mortgage  property  qua  securing  the 
loan  from  a  financial  institution,  exclusive  jurisdiction  to 
entertain and try the matter is with the Banking Court established 
under 
the  Financial 
Institutions 
(Recovery  of  Finances) 
Ordinance,  2001.  The  property  mortgaged  against  finance

facility  with  a  financial  institution,  exclusive  jurisdiction  in  the 
lis is with the Banking Court and no other court can entertain and 
try  this  issue.  Subsection  11  of  Section  15  of  the  Financial 
Institutions  (Recovery  of  Finances)  Ordinance,  2001  clearly 
reads as under:- 
“All  disputes  relating  to  the  sales  of  mortgage  property 
including  disputes  amongst  mortgages  in  respect  of 
distribution  of  the  sale  proceeds  shall  be  decided  by  the 
Banking Court.” 
 
7. 
 
The petitioner  has challenged  a registered  mortgage 
deed  in  the  suit  in  favour  of  financial  institution  against  finance 
facility  pleading  that  the  sale  deed  by  the  petitioner/plaintiff  in 
favour of  mortgagor  is forged and  fictitious. The  mortgagor was 
surety  and  a  customer 
in  accordance  with  definition  of 
“customer” mentioned in Clause (c) of Section 2 of the Financial 
Institutions  (Recovery  of  Finances)  Ordinance,  2001.  Further  in 
accordance  with  Clause  (e)  of  Section  2  of  said  Ordinance,  a 
mortgage  and  performance  of  an  undertaking  against  the 
mortgagor  fell  within  the  ambit  of  provisions  of  Financial 
Institutions  (Recovery  of  Finances)  Ordinance,  2001  and  by 
virtue  of  subsection  4  of  Section  7  of  the  Ordinance  a  Banking 
Court  is  having  exclusive  jurisdiction  in  the  matter  in  issue  and 
civil  court  was  having  no  jurisdiction.  In  this  context,  reliance 
can  be  placed  upon  the  judgments  reported  as  “Mst.  ARIFA 
SHAMS through Special Attorney versus MUHAMMAD IMTIAZ 
AHSAN  and  2  others”  (2012  CLD  483)  and  “LAHORE 
W.P.No.64308 of 2017. 
5 
BEVERAGE  COMPANY 
(PVT.)  LIMITED 
through  Chief 
Executive  versus  MUHAMMAD  JAVED  SHAFI  and  2  others” 
(2008 CLC 759).  
8. 
 
In  view  of  the  above  circumstances,  I  have  no 
reason  to  disagree  with  the  view  taken  by  the  learned  courts 
below.    The  case  law  relied  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner  is  not  inconsonance  with  the  facts  of  this  case, 
therefore,  not  applicable  and  beneficial  for  the  petitioner.  Even 
otherwise,  for  invoking  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  Article 
199  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973, 
the  petitioner  is  bound  under  the  law  to  show  that  the 
courts/forums below have exercised the jurisdiction not vested in 
them  by  law  or  there  is  some  jurisdictional  defect  in  the  orders 
impugned. Learned counsel for the petitioner could not show any 
such  defect  in  the  orders  impugned  through  this  constitutional 
petition nor I have seen any defect therein, therefore, indulgence 
of  this  Court  while  exercising  powers  under  Article  199  of  the 
Constitution  is  not  warranted  through  the  constitutional  petition 
in  hand  and  as  such  the  instant  writ  petition  being  not 
maintainable stands dismissed.
