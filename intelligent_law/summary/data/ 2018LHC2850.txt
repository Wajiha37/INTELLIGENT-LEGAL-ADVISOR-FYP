JAWAD  HASSAN,  J.-    Through  this  petition,  filed 
under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan,  1973  (the  “Constitution”),  the  Petitioner/Employees  Old-
Age  Benefit  Institution  has  challenged  the  validity  of  orders  dated 
15.02.2017  and  17.05.2017  passed  by  the  Respondent  No.1/  Punjab 
Labour  Court  No.5,  Sargodha  whereby  the  petition  filed  by  the 
Respondent  No.2  was  accepted  (15.02.2017)  and  the  revision  there-
against filed by the Petitioner (17.05.2017) was dismissed.   
BRIEF FACTS 
2. 
The  facts  succinctly  revealed  from  the  petition  are  that  the 
Petitioner  was  established  by  the  Federal  Government  in  exercise  of 
powers conferred on it under Section 4(1) of the Employees Old Age 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
2 
Benefit  Act,  1976  (the  “Act  of  1976”).  The  Act  of  1976  was 
promulgated to grant old age benefits to employees of industries and 
other establishments subject to the eligibility criteria prescribed in the 
Act of 1976. 
3. 
The Respondent No.2 who was the employee of „Sally Textile 
Mills‟  Jauharabad  from  08.08.1983  to  15.05.1991,  applied  to  the 
Petitioner for old age pension under the Act of 1976 by giving his date 
of  birth  as  08.08.1943.  Since  his  length  of  service  was  less  than  15 
years, he tried to take refuge under Section 22(2) of the Act of 1976 
whereupon the Regional Claims Committee (the “Committee”) of the 
Petitioner  considered  the  case  of  the  Respondent  No.2  but  found  his 
date  of  birth  as  08.08.1953  instead  of  08.08.1943,  therefore,  refused 
his claim. Feeling dissatisfied from the decision of the Committee, the 
Respondent No.2 filed a petition under Section 33 of the Act of 1976 
which  was  decided  in  his  favour  vide  order  dated  21.09.2010  by 
considering his date of birth as 28.06.1949. In compliance thereof the 
Petitioner  considered  the  date  of  birth  of  the  Respondent  No.2  as 
28.06.1949 but vide order dated 22.09.2010 still found him ineligible 
for old age pension on account of failing to meet the eligibility criteria 
as prescribed under Section 22 of the Act of 1976. Against which the 
Respondent  No.2  filed  review  petition  which  was  also  accepted  vide 
order dated 28.05.2012. Resultantly, the case of the Respondent No.2 
was  re-examined  by  the  Petitioner  in  the  light  of  the  above  referred 
order  and  it  was  informed  to  the  Respondent  No.2  that  no  case  for 
grant  of  old  age  pension  was  made  out  as  he  did  not  complete 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
3 
mandatory 15 years length of service and he had already received the 
old age grant, as such he is not entitled to any further benefits under 
the Act of 1976.  
4. 
Feeling  aggrieved  thereby,  the  Respondent  No.2  invoked  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Respondent  No.1  by  way  of  grievance  petition  in 
which reply was filed by the Petitioner but the same was accepted by 
the  Respondent  No.1  vide  order  dated  15.02.2017  against  which  the 
Petitioner filed review petition which was dismissed vide order dated 
17.05.2017. Hence, this petition.  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONER’S COUNSEL 
5.  Mr. Hfeez Saeed Akhtar, appearing on behalf of the Petitioner, 
inter  alia  submitted  that  the  Respondent  No.1-Labour  Court  No.5, 
Sarogdha had no jurisdiction to deal with matter in hand, as such the 
impugned  orders  are  without  any  jurisdiction  and  therefore,  liable  to 
be  set  aside  on  this  score  alone;  that  while  passing  the  impugned 
orders,  the  Respondent  No.1  has  not  considered  the  fact  that  under  
the Act of 1976 the remedy of Appeal was provided to the Respondent 
No.2 and therefore, the Respondent No.1 cannot step into the shoes of 
Appellate  Authority;  that  the  Respondent  No.2  was  never  remained 
the employee of the Petitioner rather was the employee of one „Sally 
Textile Mills‟ and his claim was rightly declined due to not fulfilling 
the eligibility criteria under the Act of 1976; that the Respondent No.2 
was  seeking  pension  under  the  Act  of  1976  and  not  the  Punjab 
Industrial  Relations  Act,  2010  (the  “Act  of  2010”),  as  such  the 
Respondent  No.1  was  not  obliged  to  extend    any  relief  to  the 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
4 
Respondent No.2; that the Respondent No.2 was not falling within the 
definition  of  a  workman,  therefore,  he  was  not  entitled    to  get  any 
relief  from  the  Respondent  No.1;  that  the  petition  before  the 
Respondent No.1 was not maintainable in presence of specific remedy 
of Appeal provided  under the Act of 1976. To fortify his contentions 
learned counsel for the Petitioner has placed reliance on the case titled 
Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution, Rawalpindi and another v. 
Ejaz Ahmad (1988 PLC (C.S.) 261), Abdul Rashid Malik and others 
v.  General  Manager,  Pakistan  Railways  and  others  (1992  PLC 
1116),  Zahid  Majid  v.  Labour  Officer  and  Inspector  of  Factories, 
Sukkur  and  3  others  (1988  PLC  914)  and  Sardar  Sultan  Ahmad 
Khan  v.  Government  of  Punjab 
through  Project  Director, 
Department of Agriculture Punjab, Lahore and 4 others (2001 MLD 
1013).  Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  also  submitted  that  if  the 
proceedings  and  the  order  passed  therein  are  without  jurisdiction, 
there is no legal requirement to avail of the alternate remedy by way 
of  an  Appeal.  In  support  of  his  above  submission  he  has  referred  to 
the cases titled Pakistan and another v. Qazi Ziauddin (P L D 1962 S 
C  440),  Nagina  Silk  Mill,  Lyallpur  v.  The  Income-tax  Officer  A-
Ward, Lyallpur (PLD1963SC322) and The Murree Brewery Co. Ltd 
v.  Pakistan  through  the  Secretary  Government  of  Pakistan  Works 
Division  and  2  others  (P  L  D  I  972  S  C  279)  and  Sky  Rooms  Ltd. 
Karachi  v.  Assistant  Collector  of  Central  Excise  &  land  Customs 
Karachi (P L D 1982 Kar. 244).

SUBMISSIONS OF LAW OFFICER 
6. 
Sadia Malik, Assistant Attorney-General also assisted the Court 
by submitting that in presence of a specific remedy under the law, the 
Respondent  No.1  should  not  have  exercised  its  jurisdiction  which 
tantamounts  to  bypassing  and  superseding  the  Authority  provided 
under  the  Statute;  that  in  the  past  this  Court  as  well  as  the  Hon‟ble 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  have  discouraged  such  like  exercising  of 
powers;  that  the  orders  of  the  Respondent  No.1  are  liable  to  be  set 
aside  because  under  the  Act  of  1976  the  remedy  of  Appeal  was 
available to the Respondent No.2.        
SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENT’S COUNSEL 
7.  Mr.  M.  R.  Awan,  Advocate  for  the  Respondent  No.2  has 
vehemently  controverted  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  Petitioner  as  well  as  the  learned  Law  Officer  and 
prayed  for  dismissal  of  the  instant  petition  on  the  grounds  that  the 
impugned  orders  have  rightly  been  passed;  that  the  impugned  orders 
are well within reasons, therefore, liable to be implemented forthwith. 
8. 
I  have  heard  the  arguments  at  length  and  perused  the  record 
minutely. 
MOOT POINTS 
9. 
For the just determination of the case, keeping in view the facts, 
arguments  of  both  the  parties  as  well  as  the  law  on  the  point,  this 
Court  deems  appropriate  to  frame  constitutional  moot  points  which 
are as follows: 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
6 
i.  Whether  the  Respondent  No.1  (Labour  Court)  can 
entertain 
the  grievance  petition 
filed  by 
the 
Respondent  No.2  (employee)  in  presence  of  statutory 
remedy  of  Appeal  provided  under  Section  35  of  the 
Act of 1976?  
ii.  Whether  the  Respondent  No.1  has  the  jurisdiction  to 
entertain 
the  grievance  petition 
filed  by 
the 
Respondent No.2 under the Act of 2010?  
iii.  Whether  the  instant  petition  is  maintainable  as  the 
remedy  of  Appeal  was  not  availed  by  the  Petitioner 
before the Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal against 
the orders of Labour Court?  
 
10.  To thrash out the above framed constitutional moot points, this 
Court has minutely examined the available record and also taken into 
consideration  the  anxious  arguments  advanced  by  both  the  sides  and 
case law on the point.  
11.  Under  Article  38  of the  Constitution  it  is  the  duty  of  the  State 
inter  alia  to  provide  for  all  persons  employed  in  the  service  of 
Pakistan or otherwise, social security by compulsory social insurance 
or other means. For the sake of brevity, the said Article is reproduced 
below and is as follows: 
“38.  Promotion  of  social  and  economic  well  being  of 
the people:- The State shall- 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
7 
(a) 
secure 
the  well-being  of 
the  people, 
irrespective of sex, caste, creed or race, by raising 
their  standard  of 
living,  by  preventing 
the 
concentration  of  wealth  and  means  of  production 
and 
distribution 
in 
the  hands  of  a  few  to  the  detriment  of  general 
interest  and  by  ensuring  equitable  adjustment  of 
rights  between  employers  and  employees,  and 
landlords and tenants. 
(b)  provide  for  all  citizens,  within  the  available 
resources  of  the  country,  facilities  for  work  and 
adequate  livelihood  with  reasonable  rest  and 
leisure. 
(c) provide for all persons employed in the service 
of  Pakistan  or  otherwise,  social  security  by 
compulsory social insurance or other means. 
(d)  provide  basic  necessities  of  life,  such  as  food, 
clothing,  housing,  education  and  medical  relief, 
for  all  such  citizens,  irrespective  of  sex,  caste, 
creed  or  race,  as  are  permanently  or  temporarily 
unable 
to 
earn  their  livelihood  on  account  of  infirmity, 
sickness or unemployment. 
(e) reduce disparity in the income and earnings of 
individuals,  including  persons  in  the  various 
classes of the service of Pakistan. 
(f) eliminate riba as early as possible; and 
(g)  ensure  that  the  shares  of  the  Provinces  in  all 
Federal  services,  including  autonomous  bodies 
and  corporations  established  by,  or  under  the 
control  of,  the  Federal  Government,  shall  be 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
8 
secured  and  any  omission  in  the  allocation  of  the 
shares  of  the  Provinces  in  the  past  shall  be 
rectified.” 
12.  The Act of 1976 was enforced with effect from April  1, 1976, 
to  achieve  the  objective  of  Article  38  (c)  of  the  Constitution,  by 
providing  for  compulsory  social  insurance.  It  extends  the  Old-Age 
Benefits  to  insured  persons  or  their  survivors.  Under  EOB  Scheme, 
Insured Persons are entitled to avail benefit like, Old-Age Pension (on 
the  event  of  retirement),  Invalidity  Pension  (in  case  of  permanent 
disability), Old-Age Grant (an Insured Person attained superannuation 
age,  but  does  not  possess  the  minimum  threshold  for  pension) 
Survivor's Pension (in case an Insured Person is expired). EOBI does 
not receive any financial assistance from the Government for carrying 
out its Operations. A contribution equal to 5% of minimum wages has 
to  be  paid  by  the  Employers  of  all  the  Industrial  and  Commercial 
Organizations  where  the  Act  of  1976  is  applicable.  Further,  the 
contribution is payable by an insured person at the rate of one percent 
of the wages in prescribed manners. 
ALTERNATE REMEDY 
i.  Whether  the  Respondent  No.1  (Labour  Court)  can 
entertain 
the  grievance  petition 
filed  by 
the 
Respondent  No.2  (employee)  in  presence  of  statutory 
remedy  of  Appeal  provided  under  Section  35  of  the 
Act of 1976?  
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
9 
13. 
It is the specific stance of the learned counsel for the Petitioner 
that  against  the  two  orders  of  the  Adjudicating  Authority,  the 
Respondent  No.2  had  the  alternate  remedy  by  way  of  filing  Appeal 
under Section 35 of the Act of 1976. For the ready reference, the said 
Section is reproduced below: 
“35. Appeal 
to  Board. Subject 
to  rules,  a  person 
aggrieved  by  a  decision  of  the  Institution  under  section 
33  or  on  a  review  under  section  34,  may  appeal  to  the 
Board.” 
14.  From  the  above  reproduced  Section,  it  is  crystal  clear  that 
against the decision of the Institution a remedy of Appeal is provided. 
The record reveals that after the denial of Respondent No.2‟s claim by 
the  Regional  Claim  Committee  of  the  Petitioner,  a  petition  under 
Section 33 of the  Act  of 1976  was  filed  by  the  Petitioner  which  was 
decided on 21.09.2010 and it was held that the correct date of birth of 
the  Petitioner  be  read  as  28.06.1949  and  directed  the  Petitioner  to 
allow  the Respondent  No.2  due benefits  as  per  provisions  of  the  Act 
of  1976.  In  pursuance  of  which  the  Petitioner  considered  the  case  of 
the  Respondent  No.2  and  still  found  him  ineligible  for  old-age 
pension on account of failing to meet the eligibility criteria prescribed 
in  Section 22 of the Act  of 1976. The  Respondent  No.2 filed  review 
petition  which  was  decided  on  28.05.2012  reiterating  the  decision  of 
the Adjudicating Authority. In compliance thereof the Petitioner again 
re-examined  his  case  and  found  that  no  case  for  grant  of  old-age 
pension  was  made  out.  Against  the  said  orders  of  the  Adjudicating 
Authority,  the  remedy  available  to  the  Respondent  No.2  was  Appeal 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
10 
under  Section  35  of  the  Act  of  1976  but  the  Respondent  No.2  filed 
grievance petition before the Labour Court which decided the matter. 
The  act  of  the  Respondent  No.2,  bypassing  the  statutory  remedy 
available to him under Section 35 of the Act of 1976, is not justified 
and  cannot  be  rescued  by  this  Court.  It  is  the  settled  view  of  the 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  where  there  is  alternate 
remedy  available  to  a  person,  he  cannot  be  allowed  to  supersede  or 
skip the same but subject to some reasonable exception viz, until the 
exercise  of  powers  is  without  jurisdiction.  Moreover,  the  reasons 
advanced  by  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  for  not  filing  the 
Appeal  are  not  persuasive  as  nobody  can  be  allowed  to  bypass  any 
provision of law and the procedure laid down for a particular purpose.  
ii.  Whether  the  Respondent  No.1  has  the  jurisdiction  to 
entertain 
the  grievance  petition 
filed  by 
the 
Respondent No.2 under the Act of 2010?  
15.  Now  I  would  like  to  render  my  findings  on  the  above  moot 
point  whether  the  Respondent  No.1/the  Punjab  Labour  Court,  No.5, 
Sargodha had the jurisdiction to exercise its powers against the orders 
of  the  Adjudicating  Authorities  or  not.  The  Respondent  No.1 
constituted  under  the  Act  of  2010  and  its  preamble  enshrines  that 
whereas  it  is  expedient  to  regulate  (i)  formation  of  trade  unions  and 
trade  union  activities,  (ii)  relations  between  employers  and  workmen 
and  (iii)  the  avoidance  and  settlement  of  any  differences  or  disputes 
arising  between  them  and  ancillary  matters.    The  Labour  Court 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
11 
established  under  Section  44  of  the  Act  of  2010  which  reads  as 
follows: 
44.  Labour  Court.–  (1)  The  Government  may,  by 
notification  in  the  official  Gazette,  establish  as  many 
Labour  Courts  as  it  considers  necessary  and,  where  it 
establishes more than one Labour Court, shall specify in 
the  notification  the  territorial  limits  within  which  or  the 
industries  or  classes  of  cases  in  respect  of  which,  each 
one of them shall exercise jurisdiction under this Act. 
      (2)    A  Labour  Court  shall  consist  of  one  presiding 
officer appointed by the Government. 
      (3)    A  person  shall  not  be  qualified  for  appointment 
as  presiding  officer  unless  he  has  been  or  is  a  District 
Judge or an Additional District Judge. 
      (4)  A Labour Court shall– 
            (a)    adjudicate  and  determine  an  industrial 
dispute which  has been referred to, or brought before it 
under the Act; 
            (b)    enquire  into  and  adjudicate  any  matter 
relating 
to 
the 
implementation  or  violation  of  a 
settlement which is referred to it by the Government; 
            (c)    try  offences  under  the  Act  and  such  other 
offences under any other law as the Government may, by 
notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf; 
            (d) try offences punishable under section 64; 
            (e)    to  deal  with cases of unfair labour practices 
specified in sections 17 and 18 on the part of employers, 
workers, trade unions, of either of them or persons acting 
on behalf of any of them, whether committed individually 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
12 
or collectively, in the manner laid down under section 33 
or section 42 or in such other way; 
            (f)    exercise  and  perform  such  other  powers  and 
functions as are or may be conferred upon or assigned to 
it by or under the Act or any other law; and 
            (g)  grant such relief as it may deem fit including 
an interim relief. 
      (4)  An interim order passed by a Labour Court shall 
stand vacated on the expiration of twenty days unless, for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, it is, from time to time 
for  a period  not  exceeding  twenty  days,  extended by  the 
Labour Court. 
Similarly, the Labour Court exercises its powers under Section 45 of 
the Act of 2010 which reads as follows:  
45. Procedure and powers of Labour Court.– (1) Subject 
to  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  while  trying  an  offence,  a 
Labour Court shall follow as nearly as possible summary 
procedure  as  prescribed  under  the  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898). 
      (2)    A  Labour  Court  shall,  for  the  purpose  of 
adjudicating  and  determining  any  industrial  dispute,  be 
deemed  to  be  a  Civil  Court  and  shall  have  the  same 
powers  as  are  vested  in  such  Court  under  the  Code  of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), including the powers 
of– 
            (a)    enforcing  the  attendance  of  any  person  and 
examining him on oath; 
            (b)  compelling the production of documents and 
material objects; and 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
13 
            (c)    issuing  commissions  for  the  examination  of 
witnesses or documents. 
      (3)    A  Labour  Court  shall,  for  the  purpose  of  trying 
an  offence  under 
the  Act  or 
the  Industrial  and 
Commercial  Employment  (Standing  Orders)  Ordinance, 
1968 (VI of 1968), have the same powers as are vested in 
the  Court  of  a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  empowered 
under  section  30  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure, 
1898 (V of 1898). 
      (4)    No  court  fee  shall  be  payable  for  filing, 
exhibiting or recording any document in a Labour Court. 
      (5)  If the parties to a case, at any time before a final 
order  is  passed  by the Labour Court, satisfy the Labour 
Court  that  the  matter  has  been  resolved  by  them 
amicably  and  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for 
withdrawing the case, it may allow such withdrawal. 
 
16. 
In view of the above referred Sections it is clear that the Labour 
Court  deals  with  the  adjudication  and  determination  of  „industrial 
disputes‟, 
„unfair 
labour  practices‟  and 
„matters 
relating 
to 
implementation  or  violation  of  a  settlement  referred  to  it  by  the 
Government‟.  As  per  Section  2  (xv)  of  the  Act  of  2010,  “industrial 
dispute”  means  “any  dispute  or  difference  between  employers  and 
employers  or  between  employers  and  workmen  or  between  workmen 
and  workmen  which  is  connected  with  the  employment  or  non-
employment or the terms of employment or the conditions of  work of 
any  person,  and  is  not  in  respect  of  the  enforcement  of  such  right 
guaranteed or accrued to him by or under any law other than the Act, 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
14 
or  any  award  or  settlement  for  the  time  being  in  force”.    But  in  the 
instant case the Petitioner is not the employer of the Respondent No.2 
who  worked  for  one  „Sally  Textile  Mills‟  in  Jauharabad  and  the 
dispute  over  payment  of  pension  under  the  Act  of  1976  was  not  an 
industrial dispute. As such, the case of the Respondent No.2 does not 
fall  within  the  above  referred  categories.  Moreover,  the  question  of 
payment  of  pension  under  the  Act  of  1976  does  not  fall  within  the 
definition  of  unfair  labour  practice  or  relates  to  „implementation  or 
violation of a settlement referred to it by the Government‟. Reliance in 
this  regard  can  be  placed  on  the  case  titled  Employees  Old-Age 
Benefits  Institution,  Rawalpindi  and  another  v.  Ejaz  Ahmad  (1988 
PLC (C.S.) 261) wherein this Court has held as under: 
“4.  The  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
appellant is forceful, that the learned lower Court had no 
jurisdiction.  Needless  to  say  that  Labour  Courts  have 
jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  upon  industrial  dispute  or 
petitions  brought  under  section  25-A  of  Industrial 
Relations.  Ordinance  1969.  The  petition  of 
the 
respondent  was  not brought under section 25-A  but was 
under section 23 of the Employees Old-Age Benefits Act, 
1976. Since the respondent could sue the appellant under 
section 23, therefore, he had brought the petition against 
the appellant otherwise he would have sued the employer 
under  section  25-A  of  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance, 
1969.  A  dispute  between  an  employer  and  employee  is 
competent  under  section  25-A  and  Labour  Courts  can 
adjudicate  upon  only  such  disputes  which  are  either 
between  the  workmen  and  employers,  between  the 
employers  and  workmen  and  between  employer  and 
employee.  Since  the  present  dispute  is  not  between  the 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
15 
employer and the respondent, the Labour Court had no` 
jurisdiction.”    
17. 
In  view  of  the  above,  the  Respondent  No.1  has  exercised  its 
powers  without  any  jurisdiction,  therefore,  its  orders  cannot  be 
sustainable  in  the  eye  of  law.  Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  has 
placed  reliance  on  the  case  titled  District  Education  Officer  and  2 
others v. Zahid Mehmood and another (PLJ 2017 Lahore 500) and 
stated that this Court has held as under: 
“As discussed above and in view of the judgments of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, referred above, the 
Respondent  No.1  has  not  acted  in  accordance  with  law 
by  assuming  the  jurisdiction  of  which  he  was  not 
bestowed. Therefore, in this case, the District & Sessions 
Judge/  Chairman,  Human  Rights  Commission 
is 
specifically  not  empowered  to  take  cognizance  of  the 
service  matter  at  hand  and  the  decision  of  the  District 
Judge  to  reinstate  the  Respondent  No.  1  is  patently 
illegal and  void, when it is expressly barred. It has also 
been  observed  that  this  Constitutional  Petition  concerns 
the unlawful jurisdiction of the District Judge in respect 
of deciding the service matter because the Petitioner has 
filed  this  petition  under  Article  199  (1)(a)(ii)  of  the 
Constitution to declare the proceedings taken (impugned 
order) within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court by a 
District  Judge;  that  have  been  taken  without  lawful 
authority and is of no legal effect.”  
18.  Under  Article  4  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Pakistan,  1973  (the  “Constitution”),  every  individual  has  the  right  to 
be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  law  and  no  person  is  liable  to  do 
which  the  law  does  not  require  him  to  do.  In  the  case  titled  Faisal 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
16 
Sultan  v.  E.D.O.  (Education)  and  others  (2011  PLC  (C.S.)  419 
[Lahore]), it has been clearly held as under:  
“An integral, intrinsic and incidental part of "law" under 
Article 4 is the right to procedural due process, right to 
be treated fairly at all times, right to procedural fairness 
and  right  to  procedural  propriety.  Right  to  a  fair 
procedure  is,  therefore,  constitutionally  guaranteed  in 
Pakistan and makes the Constitution standout proudly in 
the  Constitutions  of 
the  world.  Article  4  of 
the 
Constitution  is  a  robust  and  dynamic  amalgam  of  the 
cardinal principle of natural justice, procedural fairness 
and  procedural  propriety  of  the  English  jurisprudence 
and  Procedural  Due  Process  of 
the  American 
jurisprudence.  Constitution  of  Pakistan  has  boldly 
recognized  this  right  to  be  an  inalienable  right  of  every 
citizen or of any person for the time being in Pakistan.” 
19. 
It  has  been  established  in  the  case  of  Azizullah  Memon  v. 
Province  of  Sindh  and  another  (2007  SCMR  229)  that  since 
impugned  action  was  initiated  and  taken  to  its  logical  conclusion 
under a misconception of law and under a wrong law, it had vitiated 
entire proceedings including final order, which could not be sustained 
under the law.  
20.  Similarly,  it  is  an  established  principle  of  law  that  where 
procedure had been provided for doing a thing in a particular manner 
then  same  should  be  done  in  that  manner  alone  and  not  in  any  other 
way or it should not be done at all; otherwise it would be considered 
non-compliance of the legislative intent and would be deemed illegal.

Service Commission (2016 PLC(CS) 1184 [Quetta]); Falak Niaz v. 
Amal  Din  (2016  YLR  2047  [Peshawar]);  Sabz  Ali  Khan  v. 
Inspector  General Of  Police,  KPK  (2016  YLR  1279  [Peshawar]); 
Cantonment Board Clifton v. Sultan Ahmed Siddiqui (2016 CLC 
919  [Karachi]);  and  Federation  of  Pakistan  v.  Asad  Javed  (2016 
PLD 53 [Islamabad])) 
21.  As  discussed  above  and  in  view  of  the  judgments  of  the 
Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  referred  above,  the  Respondent 
No.1  has  not  acted  in  accordance  with  law  by  assuming  the 
jurisdiction of which he was not bestowed. Therefore, in this case, the 
Respondent No.1 was not empowered to take cognizance of the matter 
and his order is patently illegal and void, when it is expressly barred.  
22. 
In view of above mentioned facts, circumstances, laws and case 
laws,  this  Court  suffice  it  to  hold  that  the  entire  exercise  by  the 
Respondent  No.1  while  passing  the  impugned  orders  is  illegal  and 
without jurisdiction. 
iii.  Whether  the  instant  petition  is  maintainable  as  the 
remedy  of  Appeal  was  not  availed  by  the  Petitioner 
before the Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal against 
the orders of Labour Court?  
23.  So far as the question regarding the invocation of jurisdiction of 
this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  instead  of  filing 
Appeal  before  the  Labour  Appellate  Tribunal  is  concerned,  in  this 
regard  it  is  stated  that  where  the  order  is  passed  without  jurisdiction 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
18 
this  Court  under  its  constitutional  jurisdiction  can  interfere  into  the 
matter.  As  it  has  been  held  above,  the  impugned  orders  have  been 
passed  by  the  Respondent  No.1  without  jurisdiction,  therefore,  there 
was no need to avail remedy of Appeal. Reliance in this regard can be 
placed on the case titled Sardar Sultan Ahmad Khan v. Government 
of  Punjab  through  Project  Director,  Department  of  Agriculture 
Punjab,  Lahore  and  4  others  (2001  MLD  1013)  wherein  this  Court 
has held as under: 
“So  far  as  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for 
respondents 2, 4 and 5 as to failure of petitioner to avail 
alternate  remedy  is  concerned,  I  do  not  find  that  any 
equally  efficacious  alternate  remedy  was  available. 
Besides  there  is  no  dearth  of  authority,  that  where  an 
order  impugned  before  this  Court  suffers  from  illegality 
on the face of the record or is in excess of jurisdiction or 
is without jurisdiction, a certiorari may be granted even 
though the right of statutory appeal had not been availed 
of. Reference be made to the cases of "Nagina Silk Mill, 
Lyallpur  v.  The  Income  Tax  Officer,  etc."  (PLD  1963 
Supreme Court 322) and "The Murree Brewery Co. Ltd., 
v.  Pakistan  through  the  Secretary  and  2  others"  (PLD 
1972 Supreme Court 279).”    
DETERMINATION 
24. 
In view of what has been discussed above, the instant petition is 
allowed  and  the  impugned  orders  dated  15.02.2017  and  17.05.2017 
W.P. No.47263 /2017 
19 
are  hereby  set  aside.  However,  the  Respondent  No.  2  is  free  to 
approach  competent  forum  of  law  for  redressal  of  his  grievance  in 
accordance with law.
