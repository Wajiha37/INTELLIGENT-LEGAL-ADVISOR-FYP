JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing:  05.07.2018 & 06.07.2018 
 
Petitioner(s) by:  Mr. Ahmad Waheed Khan, Advocate 
 
Respondent(s) by:  M/s.  Muhammad  Ramzan  Chaudhry  & 
Sami-Uz-Zameer  Durrani,  Advocate  for 
respondent No.2. 
 
SHAHID  BILAL  HASSAN-J:  Succinctly,  the  petitioner 
No.1 entered into an agreement of sale dated 30.08.1989 with late 
S.M. Akbar with regard to the suit property  but said S.M. Akbar 
failed to honour his commitments made in the agreement of sale, 
so the petitioner No.1 instituted a suit for specific performance on 
20.04.1990,  which  was,  after  prolonged  litigation,  decreed  vide 
judgment & decree dated 09.03.2006 with respect to undisputed 3 
Kanals of plot. However, during pendency of the suit S.M. Akbar 
died and his legal heirs i.e. respondents No.3 to 9 were impleaded. 
The  judgment  debtors  when  failed  to  execute  the  sale  deed  in 
favour  of  petitioner  No.1,  the  execution  proceedings  were 
initiated.  The  respondent  No.2  filed  an  application  under  section 
12(2) C.P.C. challenging the judgment & decree dated 09.03.2006 
with  the  assertion  that  S.M.  Akbar  had  sold  his  3  Kanal  plot 
boundaries  whereof  were  described  in  document  No.5259,  Bahi 
No.1,  volume  No.3731 
registered  with  Sub-Registrar  on 
25.04.1963  and  which  was  mentioned  in  the  agreement  of  sale 
dated 30.08.1989 executed in favour of the petitioner No.I, on the 
basis of sale deed bearing document No.2728, Bahi No.1, volume 
No.2155  dated  06.04.1995  to  Mst.  Shama  Khalid/respondent 
No.11. Said Mst. Shama Khalid firstly entered into an agreement 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
2 
of  sale  of  the  said  plot  in  favour  of  respondent  No.2  on 
07.11.2002  and  thereafter  executed  sale  deed  bearing  No.6352, 
Bahi  No.1,  volume  No.201  on  19.05.2003.  The  said  application 
under  section  12(2)  C.P.C.  was  duly  contested  by  the  present 
petitioner.  The  learned  Trial  Court  vide  order  dated  06.05.2010 
dismissed  the  said  application  after  appreciating  all  facts  and 
circumstances.  
 
It is necessary to mention here that when disputed plot was 
sold to Mst. Shama Khalid/respondent No.11, the petitioner No.1 
filed  an  application  under  Order  1  rule  10  C.P.C.  for  her 
impleadment  as  defendant  but  the  learned  Trial  Court  dismissed 
the said application on 05.09.1997 by holding that the sale during 
pendency  of  suit  was  hit  by  the  principle  of  lis  pendens.  A  civil 
revision bearing No.1510 of 1997 was filed before this Court and 
subsequently  on  29.07.2003,  the  same  was  withdrawn  as  the 
learned Trial Court was restrained from passing final judgment till 
the disposal of the said civil revision.  
2. 
 
Respondent No.2 being aggrieved of the order dated 
06.05.2010 filed a civil revision bearing No.1758 of 2010 before 
this Court but due to increase in pecuniary jurisdiction, it was sent 
to the learned District Judge, concerned and same was entrusted to 
the learned Addl. District Judge, who vide impugned order dated 
15.03.2017  accepted  the  civil  revision  and  set  aside  the  order 
dated  06.05.2010  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge;  case  was 
remanded  to  the  learned  Trial  Court  for  deciding  the  application 
under section 12(2) read with section 151 C.P.C. after framing of 
issues  and  recording  evidence  of  the  parties  in  accordance  with 
law. Hence, the instant constitutional petition. 
3. 
 
Main thrust of the learned counsel for the petitioners 
is that the principle of lis pendens is attracted with full force in the 
instant  case  because  the  purchase  made  initially  by  respondent 
No.11 and then by respondent No.2 took place during pendency of 
the suit, which was instituted on 24.04.1990 and was decided on 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
3 
09.03.2006, 
therefore  neither 
the 
respondent  No.11  nor 
respondent  No.2  were  necessary  or  proper  party.  Reliance  has 
been placed on  Muhammad Arshad  Butt  &  others  v.  Muhammad 
Asif Bhatti  & others (PLD 2011 SC 905). He further argues that 
in  such  an  eventuality  the  application  under  section  12(2)  read 
with  section  151  C.P.C.  was  even  not  maintainable  and  same 
ought to have been dismissed at its inception by the learned Trial 
Court,  which  needful  was  done  as  there  was  no  need  to  frame 
issues  and  record  evidence  but  the  learned  Revisional  Court  by 
travelling  beyond  vested  jurisdiction,  without  appreciating  facts 
and circumstances of the case, mere on the basis of surmises and 
conjectures  and  wrong  assumptions  and  presumptions,  without 
appreciating law on the subject has illegally passed the impugned 
order,  which  is  nothing  but  a  mockery  of  law  and  can  only  be 
termed  as  an  order  passed  to  frustrate  the  ends  of  justice.  He 
further argues that even the application under section 12(2) C.P.C. 
filed  by  respondent  No.2  is  lacking  the  ingredients necessary  for 
filing  such  application,  which  was  rightly  dismissed  by  the 
learned  Trial  Court  but  the  learned  Revisional  Court  in  allowing 
the revision petition and remanding the matter to the learned Trial 
Court  for  its  regular  trial  has  committed  serious  illegality  and 
misreading of record, which has resulted in miscarriage of justice. 
Lastly,  he  has  prayed  that  by  allowing  the  instant  constitutional 
petition,  the  impugned  order  dated  15.03.2017  may  be  set  aside 
and  order  passed  by  the  learned  Trial  Court  dated  06.05.2010, 
whereby  application  under  section  12(2)  C.P.C.  may  be  restored 
with costs. Apart from above judgment, further reliance has been 
placed on Mst. Tabassum Shaheen v. Mst. Uzma Rahat and others 
(2012 SCMR 983) and Bagh Ali v. Mst. Ayesha and others (2013 
SCMR 551). 
4. 
 
Contrarily,  learned  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of 
respondent  No.2  has  argued  that  respondent  No.2  is  a  bondafide 
purchaser  with  consideration  without  notice.  He  has  been 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
4 
condemned  unheard  while  defiling  principle  of  audi  alteram 
partem; he has vested interests as he has paid  a huge amount for 
purchase  of  the  disputed  plot,  therefore  the  learned  Revisional 
Court  after  appreciating  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  has 
rightly reached to the conclusion that the application under section 
12(2)  C.P.C.  should  be  decided  after  framing  of  issues  and 
recording evidence of the parties, because plea of fraud could only 
ascertained  and  determined  through  evidence.  He  has  prayed  for 
dismissal  of  the  constitutional  petition  in  hand.  Relies  on  Town 
Committee,  Sujawal  v.  Hakim  Murtaza  Khan  and  others  (1989 
MLD  1955-Karachi),  Abdul  Sattar  and  6  others  v.  Ibrahim  and 
others  (PLD  1992  Karachi  323),  Ghulam  Muhammad  v.  M. 
Ahmad  Khan  and  6  others  (1993  SCMR  662),  Sunni  View

Heard. 
 The main question, which requires determination by 
this Court, is the competency of application under section 12(2) of 
the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure, 1908  (the  Code) before  the  learned 
Civil Judge. Section 12(2) of the Code provides three perspectives 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
5 
for challenging the validity of a judgment, decree or order which 
reads infra:- 
“12.  Bar to further suit. – (1)---------------------------
------------------------------------ 
(2).  Where  a  person  challenges  the  validity  of  a 
judgment,  decree  or  order  on  the  plea  of 
fraud,  misrepresentation 
or  want 
of 
jurisdiction,  he  shall  seek  his  remedy  by 
making  an  application  to  the  Court  which 
passed  the  final  judgment,  decree  or  order 
and not by a separate suit.” 
The  respondent  No.2,  in  the  present  case,  was  indebted  to 
prove the existence of any of the supra narrated pre-requisites i.e. 
fraud,  misrepresentation  and  want  of  jurisdiction.  In  the  present 
case,  the  suit  was  instituted  on  20.04.1990,  so  at  the  time  of 
institution  of  the  suit,  the  respondent  No.2  was  not  in  screen 
because  he  allegedly  purchased  the  suit  property  on  19.05.2003, 
that  too,  from  Mst.  Shama  Khalid  who  allegedly  purchased  the 
same on 06.04.1995 as has been stated above, so in this scenario, 
there appears no question of his impleadment in the suit, because 
section 52  of the  Transfer  of  Property  Act, 1882 is  much  clear 
on  the  subject  and  in  this  case  principle  of  lis  pendens  fully 
attracts.  For  ready  reference  section  52  of  the  Act  ibid  with 
explanation is reproduced infra: 
“During  the  pendency  of  in  any  Court  having 
authority  in  Pakistan  or  established  beyond  the 
limits  of  Pakistan  by  the  Central  Government  of 
any  suit  or  proceeding  which  is  not  collusive  and 
in  which  any  right  to  immovable  property  is 
directly  and  specifically  in  question,  the  property 
cannot  be  transferred  or  otherwise  dealt  with  by 
any  party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
6 
the  rights  of  any  other  party  thereto  under  any 
decree  or  order  which  may  be  made  therein, 
except under the authority of the Court an on such 
terms as it may impose. 
 
Explanation:-- For the purpose of this section, the 
pendency of a suit or proceeding shall be deemed 
to  commence  from  the  date  of  the  presentation  of 
the plaint or the institution of the proceeding in a 
Court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  and  to  continue 
until  the  suit  or  proceeding  has  been  disposed  of 
by  a 
final  decree  or  order  and  complete 
satisfaction  or  discharge  of  such  decree  or  order 
has been obtained, or has become unobtainable by 
reason of the expiration of any period of limitation 
prescribed for the execution thereof by any law for 
the time being in force.” (Underline for emphasis) 
 
Though respondent No.2 had pleaded ignorance of knowledge and 
asserted that being bona fide purchaser, his rights  were protected 
but  in  such  like  case  principle  of  caveat  emptor  was  equally 
applicable and when litigation in respect of the suit property was 
pending,  such  transfer  was  to  be  governed  by  the  provisions  of 
section 52 of the Act ibid which lays down that a transaction made 
during pendency of litigation cannot affect the rights of any other 
party  to  the  litigation,  which  may  be  acquired  by  it  under  the 
decree  passed  by  the  Court;  reliance  can  safely  be  placed  on 
Industrial  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  through  Deputy  Chief 
Manager v. Saadi Asmatullah and others (1999 SCMR 2874) and 
Khadim  Hussain  v.  Abid  Hussain  and  others  (PLD  2009 
Supreme Court 419) as well as the celebrated judgment reported 
as Muhammad Arshad Butt & others v. Muhammad Asif Bhatti & 
others (PLD 2011 SC 905). 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017

7. 
 
So  far  as  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for 
the  respondent  No.2  that  application  under  section  12(2)  of  the 
Code cannot be dismissed without framing of issue and recording 
of  evidence  is  concerned,  it  is  observed  that  the  same  is 
misconceived and ill-founded. It is not a universal principle that in 
each  and  every  case,  the  Court  is  bound  to  frame  issues  before 
deciding  the  fate  of  an  application  under  section  12(2)  of  the 
Code,  rather  the  Court  can  decide  such  like  application  without 
framing  of  issues  while  considering  the  material  made  available 
on the record. In this regard reliance is placed on Nazir Ahmed v. 
Muhammad  Sharif  and  others  (2001  SCMR  46),  wherein  it  has 
invariability been held:- 
‘8. 
In  Amiran  Bibi  and  others  v.  Muhammad 
Ramzan and others (1999 SCMR 1334) this  Court 
has laid down the rule which reads as follows:- 
“it  is  not  the  requirement  of  law  that  the 
Court while dealing with the allegation under 
section 
12(2),  C.P.C.  must 
in 
all 
circumstances  frame  issues,  record  evidence 
and  follow  procedure  prescribed  for  decision 
of  the  suit.  The  question  whether  or  not  the 
issues  are  to  be  formulated  and  evidence  of 
the  parties 
recorded 
in 
resolving 
the 
allegations  of  fraud  and  misrepresentation, 
depends  upon  the  facts  of  each  case  in 
consonance with justice.” 
 
 
It was further observed that:- 
“the  impugned  order  was  passed  by  the 
learned Judge in Chambers after hearing both 
the  parties  but  the  petitioners  never  sought 
permission  to  produce  evidence  in  support  of 
their application nor there was any prayer for 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
8 
formulation  of  issue at  the  time  of hearing of 
the application.” 
The  above  principle  has  again  been  reaffirmed  by 
this  Court  in  Mrs.  Amina  Bibi  through  General 
Attorney v. Nasrullah and others 2000 SCMR 296 in 
the following terms:- 
“While dealing with allegations under section 
12(2),  C.P.C.,  it  was  not  incumbent  upon 
Court that it must, in all circumstances, frame 
issues,  record  evidence  and  follow  procedure 
prescribed for the suit.” 
8. 
 
In addition to the above, mere allegation of fraud and 
misrepresentation  is  not  sufficient  to  overdo  the  judgment  of  a 
Court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  rather  the  person  who  asserts 
fraud  and  misrepresentation  has  to  bring  on  record  cogent  and 
plausible material in order to substantiate his such plea, which is 
lacking  in  this  case.  Perusal  of  the  impugned  order  dated 
15.03.2017  passed  by  the  learned  Addl.  District  Judge,  Lahore 
goes to evince that while setting aside the order dated 06.05.2010 
the  main  stress of  the  learned  Revisional  Court  was  on  the point 
that learned trial Court decided the fate of the application without 
framing of issues. In this regard, suffice to say that in view of the 
principles laid down in the judgments referred to above there is no 
need of framing of issues in each and every case for deciding an 
application under section 12(2) of the Code, so interference in the 
order  of  the  learned Civil  Judge  by  the  learned  Revisional  Court 
was  not  warranted.  As  such,  the  learned  Revisional  Court  has 
erred in law while setting aside the well-reasoned order passed by 
the  learned  Civil  Judge  dismissing  the  application  under  section 
12(2) of the Code. 
9. 
 
Apart  from  this,  the order  of  the  revisional Court  is 
not  sacrosanct  which  cannot  be  interfered  with  in  any  of  the 
circumstances. Whenever, it is established that the revisional court 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017 
9 
has  committed  some  illegality  culminating  into  passing  of  an 
order  which  is  perverse  and  perfunctory,  this  Court  is  competent 
to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction as ordained in Article 199 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973; in this regard guideline 
can  be  sought  from  Muhammad  Anwar  and  others  v.  Mst.  Ilyas 
Begum  and  others  (PLD  2013  Supreme  Court  255)  and 
Muhammad Akbar v. Muhammad Malik and another  (PLD 2005 
Lahore 1), wherein it was held:- 
“7.  Anyhow,  as  regards  the  objections  of  the 
learned  counsel  for  the  respondent,  suffice  it  to  say 
that,  it  is  not  an  absolute  rule  that  an  order  passed 
in  revision,  cannot  at  all  be  interfered  in  the 
Constitutional  jurisdiction.  In  my  view,  where  the 
justice  demands,  an  exception  can  be  taken  thereto 
and  the  High  Court  besides  Article  199  of  the 
Constitution,  can  invoke  its  supervisory  jurisdiction 
under Article 203 of the Constitution, to correct the 
orders,  when  are  perverse,  fraudulent,  erroneous 
and have been passed either by express violation or 
the  ignorance  of  any  provision  of  law.  Because  the 
order of the learned revisional Court is of the above 
nature, therefore, I deem it proper to correct it in my 
Constitutional jurisdiction…………..” 
10. 
 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  has  been  established 
that  the  learned  revisional  Court  has  failed  to  exercise  vested 
jurisdiction  as  per  mandate  of  law  and  by  travelling  beyond  the 
vested jurisdiction has passed the impugned order illegally, which 
cannot be allowed to hold field further. 
11. 
 
As  far  as,  the  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned 
counsel for the respondent No.2 is concerned, with utmost respect 
to  the  same,  it  has  no  relevance  to  the  peculiar  facts  and 
circumstances  of  the  case  in  hand;  thus,  it  does  not  render  any 
assistance or help to the respondent No.2’s case. 
W.P.No.36483 of 2017

13. 
 
In  view  of  the  above,  while  placing  reliance  on 
judgments  supra  as  well  as  judgments  reported  as  Muhammad 
Arshad  Butt  &  others  v.  Muhammad  Asif  Bhatti  &  others  (PLD 
2011 SC  905),  Mst.  Tabassum Shaheen  v. Mst.  Uzma  Rahat  and 
others (2012 SCMR 983) and Bagh Ali v. Mst. Ayesha and others 
(2013 SCMR 551), the constitutional petition in hand is allowed, 
consequent whereof the impugned order dated 15.03.2017 passed 
by  the  learned  Revisional  Court  is  set  aside  and  the  order  dated 
06.05.2010  passed  by 
the 
learned  Civil  Judge  dismissing 
application  under  section  12(2)  of  the  Code  filed  by  the 
respondent No.2 stands restored, with no order as to the costs.
