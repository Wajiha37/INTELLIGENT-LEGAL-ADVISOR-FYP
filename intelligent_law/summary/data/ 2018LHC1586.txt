AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN, J.     Through  this  writ  petition 
the  petitioners  claiming  to  be  the  legal  heirs  of  declarant  Khuda 
Bakhsh  have  challenged  the  order  dated  27.01.2012  passed  by 
the Chairman, Federal Land Commission, Islamabad allotting the 
land 
in 
favour  of 
respondents  being 
residents  of 
the 
village/adjoining areas of the District.  
2. 
 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  mainly  argued 
that  the  matter  of  petitioners  was  a  pending  case  and  not  a  past 
and  closed  transaction,  therefore,  in  the  light  of  pronouncement 
of august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as  “QAZALBASH 
W.P.No.12042 of 2014. 
2 
WAQF  and  others  versus  CHIEF  LAND  COMMISSIONER, 
PUNJAB,  LAHORE  and  others”  (PLD  1990  Supreme  Court 
99)  no  new  resumption  order  could  have  been  passed  and 
therefore the allotment order is against the law. The basis for this 
argument  is  that  with  regard  to  holding  of  Khuda  Bakhsh 
declarant  predecessor  of  petitioners  the  orders  of  resumption 
dated  02.10.1978  and  30.06.1979  were  passed  by  the  Deputy 
Land  Commissioner,  Mianwali.  On  the  scrutiny  of  the  land  of 
declarant  Khuda  Bakhsh  by  the  Head  of  Inspection  Team, 
Federal Land Commission, Lahore through inspection note dated 
31.03.1980  the  matter  for  redetermination  of  holding  of  Khuda 
Bakhsh  was  taken  up  by  the  Land  Commissioner,  Sargodha 
Division,  Sargodha  and  vide  order  dated  26.08.1984  it  was  held 
that: 
“In the  light of the advice of the Inspection Officer of the 
Federal  Land  Commission,  dated  31.3.1980  read  with  the 
statement of Karam Hussain elder son of the declarant, the 
case  is  remanded  to  the  Deputy  Land  Commissioner, 
Bhakkar  with  the  direction  that  he  may  revise  the  orders 
dated  2.10.1978  and  30.6.1979  of  the  Deputy  Land 
Commissioner Mianwali. He may also proceed against the 
declarant  for  not  filing  the  declaration  form  under  MLR-
115  of  1972  and  resume  the  excess  area  after  getting  the 
choice  from  the  heirs  of  the  declarant.  Karam  Hussain 
elder son of the declarant who  is present  is being directed 
to appear before the Deputy Land Commissioner, Bhakkar 
on 16.9.1984.” 
 
In this view, learned counsel  for the petitioners argues that after 
that  Deputy  Land  Commissioner  has  never  decided  the  matter 
and  as  per  learned  counsel  the  previous  orders  passed  by  the 
Deputy  Land  Commissioner  dated  2.10.1978  and  30.06.1979 
W.P.No.12042 of 2014. 
3 
were  set-aside,  therefore,  it  was  a  pending  case  and  as  such  no 
resumption  orders  could  have  been  passed  after  23.03.1990  in 
the light of case law referred supra.  
3. 
 
On 
the  other  hand, 
learned  counsel  for 
the 
respondents  argues  that  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned 
counsel  for  the  petitioners  are  absolutely  against  the  record  and 
misconceived.  The  scrutiny  committee  was  of  the  view  that 
further  land  of  the  declarant  is  resume  able,  the  detail  of  which 
was  given  in  Annexure-IV  of  the  Note  of  Head  of  Inspection 
Team,  Federal  Land  Commission,  Lahore  and  further  the  orders 
passed by the Deputy Land Commissioner dated 02.10.1978 and 
30.06.1979  were  never  set-aside  but  for  further  resumption  the 
Land  Commissioner  observed  that  Deputy  Land  Commissioner 
may  review  the  order.  Further  that  it  was  a  past  and  closed 
transaction  and  resumption  orders  passed  by  the  Deputy  Land 
Commissioner  were  final,  therefore,  rightly  allotted  by  the 
Chairman,  Federal  Land  Commission  in  favour  of  respondents. 
Lastly argued that if there was any right in the property, that was 
with  the  province  of  Punjab  and  province  of  Punjab  has  never 
disputed the allotment in favour of respondents.  
4. 
 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at 
full  length  and  also  gone  through  the  record  minutely  with  their 
able assistance.  
5. 
 
Since  a  limited  question  is  before  us,  therefore,  we 
answer  only  that  question  through  our  view.  The  orders  dated 
W.P.No.12042 of 2014. 
4 
02.10.1978  and  30.6.1979  passed  by 
the  Deputy  Land 
Commissioner  to  the  extent  of  resumption  done  through  said 
orders  were  final.  The  Head  of  Inspection  Team  while 
scrutinizing  the  land  of  declarant  Khuda  Bakhsh  observed  that 
further  land  is  resume  able  and  the  matter  was  taken  up  by  the 
Land  Commissioner,  who  in  its  order  dated  26.8.1984  has 
observed  that  the  Deputy  Land  Commissioner  may  review  the 
orders.  Neither  the  Land  Commissioner  set-aside  the  orders 
passed by the Deputy Land Commissioner nor he was competent 
to  do  so.  There  are  only  observations  in  the  order  of  Land 
Commissioner  dated  26.8.1984  for  review.  Even  the  Land 
Commissioner was not competent to grant permission  of review, 
rather the permission under Rule 12 of the Punjab Land Reforms 
Rules  of  1972  was  required  from  the  Additional  Chief  Land 
Commissioner  or  the  Chief  Land  Commissioner  and  by  no 
stretch of imagination it can be said that the matter was reopened 
by  the  order  of  Land  Commissioner  dated  26.8.1984,  therefore, 
reliance of learned counsel for the petitioners upon the judgment 
of  QAZALBASH  TRUST  case  by  stating  that  no  land  was  to  be 
resumed  after  23.3.1990  of  the  declarant  Khuda  Bakhsh  is 
absolutely  misconceived  and  not  tenable,  as  after  passing  of 
order dated 26.8.1984 the petitioners even remained silent as this 
order was not in their favour rather against their rights as further 
land  was  to  be  resumed,  first  time  through  the  instant  writ  petition 
which  was  filed  in  the  year  2014  they  want  to  take  benefit  of 
W.P.No.12042 of 2014. 
5 
order  dated  26.08.1984,  that  too,  by  misinterpreting  the  said 
order according to their own version.  
6. 
 
We are fortified by our view that it was a close and 
past transaction. Light can be taken from the judgment of august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “MUHAMMAD SAFDAR 
and  others  versus  PUNJAB  LAND  COMMISSION  through 
Secretary  and  others”  (2012  S  C  M  R  1725).  We  have  further 
observed 
that 
the  resumed 
land  vests 
in 
the  provincial 
government,  therefore,  in  the  light  of  judgment  of  august 
Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  reported  as  “SHAH  JEHAN  KHAN 
ABBASI 
versus  DEPUTY 
LAND 
COMMISSIONER, 
BAHAWALPUR  and  another”  (2006  S  C  M  R  771)  it  is  the 
provincial  government  which  can  agitate  against  the  order 
impugned through this writ petition.  
7. 
 
Though we are not fully satisfied with the powers of 
Chief  Land  Commissioner  directly  entertaining  the  application 
for  allotment  of  land  to  the  tenant  or  the  persons  eligible  for 
allotment  under  the  Land  Reforms  Regulation  or  Land  Reforms 
Act  but  the  petitioners  have  no  locus  standi  to  challenge  the 
allotment  in  favour  of  respondents.  It  will  be  the  provincial 
government  or  the  other  claimant  or  contestant  of  right  of 
allotment with the respondents to challenge that order. We make 
it clear that if the provincial  government or any person claiming 
a right of allotment challenges the order of allotment in favour of 
respondents passed by the Chairman, Federal Land Commission, 
W.P.No.12042 of 2014. 
6 
Islamabad  dated  27.01.2012,  this  order  will  not  be  hurdle  in  the 
way.  
8. 
 
The  resume  of  above  discussion  is  that  the  instant 
writ petition being not competent stands dismissed.
