Mr.  Khursheed  Ahmad,  AAO,  CMA

Shahid Jamil Khan, J:-  Through 
this 
petition, 
petitioner  has  challenged  Rule  8(2)(a)(iii)  of  the  Pension 
Rules 
for  Civil  Servant’s  Family  Pension 
(Federal 
Government),  which  was 
introduced 
through  Office 
Memorandum  dated  03.07.1997,  whereby  eldest  surviving 
unmarried  daughter  was  entitled  to  receive  pension  of  her 
father. The same is reproduced hereunder:- 
“(iii) 
failing  (i)  and  (ii)  to  the  eldest  surviving 
unmarried  daughter  till  her  marriage;  if  the  eldest 
daughter  marries  or  dies  the  next  eldest  daughter 
till her marriage.” 
    
The petitioner, being second and unmarried daughter, 
felt  aggrieved  of  the  rule  and  challenged  the  same  on  the 
touchstone  of  Article  25  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”).  
W.P.No.69226 of 2017.

2.  
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  in 
Punjab,  the  rule  was  rationalized  and  pension  is  divided 
amongst all unmarried daughters.  
3.  
The  petitioner  also  challenged 
letters  dated 
21.02.2017  and  31.03.2017,  whereby  respondent  No.1 
refused to give pension to the petitioner with objection firstly 
that  only  eldest  unmarried  daughter  is  entitled  and  secondly 
with  the  observation  that  even  if  the  second  daughter  is 
entitled,  the  eldest  daughter  cannot  surrender  her  right  in 
favour of the petitioner. 
4.  
 Reply  was  filed  by  the  learned  Deputy  Attorney 
General, operative part of which is reproduced hereunder:- 
(Regulations  Wing)  vide 
dated 
“It  is  submitted  that  point  was  referred  to  Finance 
Division  (Regulation  Wing)  by 
the  MAG  office 
Rawalpindi that “if the eldest un-married daughter 
surrenders  her  right  to  pension  in  favour  of 
youngest  sister,  the  pension  may  be  granted  to 
youngest  daughter  instead  of  eldest  un-married 
daughter”.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  Finance 
their  U.O 
Division 
No.F.2(2)-REg.6/96-XIV-1325 
08.12.2017 
(copy enclosed) has clarified that after extending the 
benefit  of  family  pension  to  daughter  for  life/till 
marriage vide Finance Division O.M. No.2-(2)-R.6/96 
dated 03.07.1997, and to widowed daughter/divorced 
for  life  or  till  marriage  re-marriage,  without  any  age 
limit  in  terms  of  Finance  Division  O.M.  No.2(2)-
R.6/96.IX-700 dated 07.07.2015, there is no need to 
impose  this  restriction  as  it  would  not  make  any 
difference. Further, no embargo has been imposed in 
Liberalized  Family  Pension  Rules,  1983  for  grant  of 
family  pension  to  the  younger  daughter  if  the  elder 
daughter refused to receive family pension.  
In  view  of  the  above,  it  is  submitted  that  family 
pension  claim  in  respect  of  the  appellant  i.e.  Zakia 
Shaukat  will  be 
receipt  of  MES 
department.”

From perusal of the above noted reply, the grievance 
of  the  petitioner  to  extent  of  surrendering  pension  in  favour 
of the petitioner was being processed and was expected to be 
completed. The reply was silent about the query of this Court 
W.P.No.69226 of 2017.

vide  order  dated  13.09.2017,  whereby  it  was  asked  to  reply 
why  rule  has  not  been  rationalized  as  had  been  done  by  the 
Government  of  Punjab.  The  respondents  were  further  asked 
to 
justify 
the 
impugned 
rule 
for 
depriving 
a 
widow/divorcee/unmarried  daughter,  standing  on  the  same 
pedestal.  It  was  undertaken  before  the  Court  that  summary 
for the purpose was forwarded for necessary amendments in 
the rule.
