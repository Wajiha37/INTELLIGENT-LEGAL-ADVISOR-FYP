2. 
As  per  First  Information  Report,  the  facts  in  brief  are 
that  after  receiving  spy  information,  on  03.05.2016  at  10:45  a.m. 
the  appellants  were  intercepted  and  arrested  from  Car  No.EC 
547/Islamabad.  On  search,  2500  grams  explosive  substance  and 
30-bore  pistol  along  with  10-live  bullets  were  recovered  from 
possession  of  Khalid  Mehmood  whereas  from  possession  of  Ejaz 
Ahmed,  Rifle  8-MM  was  recovered.  From  further  search  of  Car,  a 
Rifle 222-bore along with two magazines, 70-rounds, one Rifle 44-
bore,  10-Magazines  and  160  rounds  were  also  recovered.  In 
addition thereto, from dash-board of car four pamphlets of Sipa-e-
Sihaba  Pakistan  were  also  found.  It  is  alleged  in  the  FIR  that  the 
aforesaid explosive  substance  was  to be  used  for  terrorist  activity 
by the accused persons. 
3. 
At trial, the prosecution in addition to the documentary 
evidence  produced  as  many  as  eleven  witnesses.  Besides  CW-1 
Nadeem Iqbal 788/C was summoned and examined by the Court. 
The  statements  of  both  the  appellants  were  recorded  under 
CRL. Appeal No.474/2018. 
 
3 
Section 342, Cr.P.C., who denied their guilt and pleaded innocent. 
In ultimate, the trial culminated in conviction and sentence to the 
appellants, noted above; hence this appeal. 
4. 
After hearing the arguments and going through record 
of  the  case,  we  find  the  following  discrepancies  appeared  in  the 
evidence causing serious dent to the prosecution case culminating 
into appellants’ acquittal from the charge alleged against them: 
 
i) 
PW-10  Muhammad  Maalik,  S.I.  (a  recovery  witness) 
was  the  member  of  patrolling  party,  which  alleged  to 
have  arrested  the  appellants  and  explosive  substance 
was recovered from the possession of Khalid Mehmood 
whereas  admittedly,  as  established  from  Rapt  No.18 
dated  03.05.2016,  said  PW  left  the  Police  Station  at 
3:50  a.m.  to  proceed  to  Lahore  along  with  accused 
Imran  and  Marya  Gul-victim  in  connection  with  FIR 
No.33,  dated  27.04.2016  u/s  376,  P.P.C.,  on  official 
vehicle  No.CHG-1005,  which  was  driven  by  Nadeem 
Iqbal  788/C, 
for  the  purpose  of  DNA  analysis, 
therefore,  his  presence  along  with  the  same  driver  in 
the same vehicle at the spot was not justified. 
 
PW-9 Nazir Ahmed, SI, head of patrolling party claimed 
ii) 
in his testimony that PW-10 Muhammad Malik was with 
CRL. Appeal No.474/2018. 
 
4 
him  when  he  conducted  the  raid  and  was  part  of  his 
patrolling  party  which  could  not  be  accepted  being 
contrary  to  record  and  he  did  not  claim  that  PW-10-
Muhammad Maalik, SI was called subsequently in order 
to  join  the  patrolling  party  as  the  same  stand  was 
taken by CW-1 in order to prove his presence alongwith 
PW-10  at  the  time  of  occurrence.  Even  in  legal 
parlance,  no  officer  has  any  power  to  call  any  other 
officer/official without informing to his office, which fact 
should  have  specifically  been  incorporated  in  the  Daily 
Roznamcha. No document had been produced in Court 
to  strengthen  the  testimony  of  CW-1;  besides,  it  was 
not the stand of head of the patrolling party. 
 
iii)  Nadeem  Iqbal  788/C,  Driver,  was  summoned  by  the 
Court  as  a  Court  Witness,  who  tried  to  explain  that 
although they left the police station for the purpose of 
DNA test for Lahore along with the accused Imran and 
victim  Marya  Gul  but  on  SHO’s  request  which  they 
received  during  their  journey,  they  came  back  and 
joined  the  raiding  party.  This  justification  is  baseless 
and  has  unnecessarily  been  given  weight  while 
convicting  the  present  appellants  for  the  reason  that 
the  SHO-Nazir  Ahmad  (PW-9),  head  of  the  patrolling 
CRL. Appeal No.474/2018. 
 
5 
party,  had  never  claimed  that  Muhammad  Malik,  SI 
(PW-10)  was  not  performing  the  patrolling  duty  with 
him.  Besides  this,  the  time  of  occurrence  was  10:45 
a.m.  whereas  Muhammad  Malik,  SI  along  with  driver 
Nadeem  Iqbal-CW  left  the  Police  Station  at  3:50  a.m. 
and  question  does  not  arise  that  after  about  seven 
hours  they  had  not  reached  Lahore  and  instead  were 
available near the place of occurrence;  
 
Even  if  the  justification  given  by  Nadeem  Iqbal-CW  is 
iv) 
accepted as true, absence of accused-Imran and victim 
Marya Gul for whose  DNA analysis they were going to 
Lahore  also 
falsifies  rather  contradicts  his  own 
statement  as  CW,  which  even  otherwise  was  not  the 
case of PW-9, head of alleged patrolling party; 
 
v)  On the other hand while recording the statement of the 
appellants  under  Section  342,  Cr.P.C.,  in  response  to 
the question put by the prosecution, ‘why this case was 
registered  against  you  and  why  the  PWs  deposed 
against you?’, the answer is more appropriate, which is 
accepted  especially  when  the  prosecution  evidence  is 
deficient,  which 
is  expedient 
to  be  reproduced 
hereunder:-

is  absolutely  false  and 
“The 
baseless. The entire story of arrest and recovery 
is  falsified  by  the  prosecution  own  evidence 
available on the record and the statement of the 
PWs. 
 
Nine  persons  of  our  family  were  murdered 
and  9  accused  were  arrested  and  after  trial 
were  sentenced  to  death  and  four  nominated 
accused  are  still  POs.  On  29.4.2016  SDPO 
Talagang  Malik  Abdul  Rehman  alongwith 
complainant/SHO  PS  Lawa  came  to  our  village 
and  forced  us  to  compromise  with  the  accused 
of  our  murder  case  otherwise  they  threatened 
us  for  the  consequences.  We  were  summoned 
by the DSP Malik Abdul Rehman to his office at 
Talagang  on  the  next  date  i.e.  30.4.2016  and 
when we went to the office of DSP on the next 
day  on  the  rented  vehicle  bearing  registration 
No.EC  547  ICT  driven  by  Muhammad  Altaf 
driver, the DSP illegally detained both of us and 
the  driver  Muhammad  Altaf.  Mst.  Noor  Jahan 
filed petition u/s 491 Cr.P.C. on 3.5.2016 before 
ASJ Talagang, the bailiff was appointed, the raid 
was  conducted  but  we  were  not  recovered  as 
we  were  not  kept  in  the  police  station.  Mst. 
Noor Jahan thereafter filed criminal Misc. No.11-
H  of  2016  before  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court, 
Rawalpindi  Bench  and  on  5.5.2016,  the  DSP 
Abdul  Rehman  appeared  before  the  Hon’ble 
High Court and produced the copy of the FIR of 
the  instant  case  whereupon  the  relatives  came 
to  know  that  we  are  in  the  custody  of  the 
police.  After  our illegal detention  on 30.4.2016, 
the complainant, DSP alongwith the local police 
conducted raid at our house and took alongwith 
them  the  licensed  weapons  alongwith  the 
license  and  valuable  articles  from  our  house 
which  are  still 
their  possession.  The 
complainant changed our licensed weapons and 
got  registered  the  instant  false  case  on  the 
asking  of  the  DSP  in  connivance  with  our 
accused.  The  PWs/eye  witnesses 
frankly 
conceded before the  court that he had  gone to 
Lahore  on  official  vehicle  No.CHG-1005  driven 
by  Muhammad  Nadeem  788/C  which  is  duly 
in

clear  that  neither  the  official  vehicle  was  there 
nor  the  PWs  mentioned  in  the  FIR  were  there 
and the entire story is false and fabricated. 
investigation,  the  IO  had  also 
 
conceded  before  the  court  that  the  person  of 
the locality had not verified the story of FIR.”   
 
 
During 
5. 
We  are  persuaded  that  the  prosecution  has  not  been 
able  to  establish  its  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt  against  the 
appellants and the evidence on record is not confidence inspiring; 
hence  cannot  be  made  basis  for  conviction.  Resultantly,  present 
appeal  succeeds,  the  conviction  and  sentence  of  the  appellants 
pronounced  in  judgment  dated  24.05.2018  is  set-aside  and  both 
the appellants are acquitted of the charge, who are directed to be 
released forthwith if not required in any other case.
