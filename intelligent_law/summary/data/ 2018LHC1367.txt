Through  instant  and  connected  petitions  under  Article  199 
(i)(b)(ii)  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, 
1973  (“the  Constitution”),  petitioner  has  sought  writs  of  quo 
warranto  from  this  Court  requiring  Malik  Muhammad  Nawaz, 
Member  of  Provincial  Assembly  (“MPA”),  Punjab  from  PP-71 
Faisalabad  (respondent  No.1  in  this  petition)  and  Muhammad

(respondent  No.1  in  connected  petition)  to  show  under  what 
authority of law, they claim to hold the said offices and election for 
the said seats be declared void, of no legal effect and vacant with 
consequential  direction  to  respondent  /  Election  Commission  of 
Pakistan (“ECP”) to hold fresh elections in accordance with law. 
3. 
Brief facts, necessary for disposal of instant petition, are that 
respondent  No.1  was  elected  as  MPA  from  PP-71,  Faisalabad  in 
General  Election,  2013  (during  pendency  of  this  petition,  the 
Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, on completion of its five years’ 
term, stands dissolved on and from 31.05.2018 in terms of Article 
107  of 
the  Constitution).  Petitioner,  being  voter  of  said 
constituency  and  elected  Chairman  of  City  Union  Council  145 
(Choohar  Majra),  Ghulam  Muhammad  Abad,  Municipal 
Corporation,  Faisalabad,  filed  instant  petition  inter  alia  on  the 
ground of concealment of assets / liabilities by respondent No.1.  
 
In  connected  petition,  petitioner  has  sought  writ  of  quo 
warranto  against  Muhammad  Razzaq  Malik  (respondent  No.1 
therein)  qua  his  office  as  Mayor  of  Faisalabad  Municipal 
Corporation  and  Chairman  of  City  Union  Council  No.137, 
Faisalabad with the allegation of concealment of assets / liabilities. 
4. 
Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  submits  that  at  the  time  of 
contesting General Election, 2013, respondent / Malik Muhammad 
Nawaz  was  director /  share-holder  of  Malik  Ghee  &  Cooking Oil 
Mills  Ltd.  (“Malik  Ghee”),  Benz  Maize  Products  International 
Ltd.  (“Benz  Maize  Products”),  Faisalabad  and  partner  of  Malik 
Protein,  Faisalabad,  and  respondent  /  Muhammad  Razzaq  Malik 
was chief executive / director / share-holder of Malik Ghee, Benz 
Maize  Products,  Faisalabad  and  Benz  Industries  Ltd.,  Lahore, 
however,  in  the  columns  of  liabilities  and  loans,  they  wrote  NIL 
liabilities  and  NIL  loans,  thus,  filed  incorrect  statements  of  their 
assets  /  liabilities  by  concealing  bank  guarantees  against  loans 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
3 
from  different  banks.  He  adds  that  upon  institution  of  suit  by 
respondent  /  Bank  of  Punjab,  both  the  respondents  entered  into  a 
settlement agreement dated 18.12.2017 and filed a joint application 
before learned Banking Court for passing consent decree, in order 
to  avoid  disclosure  of  loan  to  public  at  large.  He  further  submits 
that  as per  Articles 62  &  63 of  the  Constitution,  said  respondents 
are  no  more  Sadiq  and  Ameen,  thus,  are  liable  to  be  declared 
disqualified for concealment of liabilities. He further contends that 
concealment in declaration under oath is not condonable in the eye 
of law. He has relied upon Dr. Muhammad Afzal and others v. The 
State (2001 SCMR 1615), Rahim Tahir v. Ahmed Jan and 2 others

5. 
Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  submits  that 
petitioner  has  failed  to  avail  the  alternate  remedy  of  invoking 
jurisdiction  of  the  Speaker  of  Punjab  Assembly  and  respondent-
ECP under Article 63(2) & (3) of the Constitution, before invoking 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. He adds that petitioner has 
also been unable to raise any objection at the time of submission of 
nomination papers. He adds that previously, petitioner filed similar 
petition  before  respondent-ECP  on  the  same  grounds,  but  it  was 
dismissed as withdrawn with permission to file fresh one, however, 
this fact has been concealed while filing these petitions. He further 
contends  that  the  bank’s  sanctioned  finance  facilities  were  fully 
secured  and  currently, no  amount  / liability  is  outstanding  against 
respondents.  He  adds  that  there  is  series  of  litigation  on  civil  as 
well  as  criminal  sides  between  petitioner  and  respondents,  and 
these petitions have been filed  with mala fide. He further submits 
that  respondents  disclosed  their  share-holding  in  the  companies 
while  submitting  nomination  papers  and,  as  the  companies  are 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
6 
separate  legal  entities,  therefore,  no  office  /  designation  held  in 
such companies or liabilities of such companies was required to be 
mentioned. He further submits that had he declared such liabilities, 
it  would  not  have  any  effect  on  their  candidature  as  bona  fide 
omission does not invite disqualification under relevant provisions 
of law. He adds that the allegations leveled against respondents, in 
absence of mala fide and element of  mens rea in any omission or 
defect  in  providing  information,  are  not  sustainable.  He  adds  that 
no  decree  of  default  has  been  passed  against  respondents  by  a 
Court of law. In support of his contentions, he has  referred to Dr. 
Kamal  Hussain  and  7  others  v.  Muhammad  Sirajul  Islam  and 
others  (PLD  1969  Supreme  Court  42),  Syed  Saeed  Hassan  v. 
Pyar  Ali  and  7  others  (PLD  1976  Supreme  Court  6),  Qazi

6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
7. 
It  is  the  stance  of  petitioner  that  respondents  executed 
various  bank  guarantees,  but  they  suppressed  and  concealed  the 
liabilities  /  loans  as  well  as  correct  value  of  their  assets  and 
accounts of the company i.e. Malik Ghee maintained with different 
banks,  in  the  relevant  columns  of  their  nomination  papers,  hence, 
they  are  liable  to  be  disqualified  within  the  contemplation  of 
Articles 62 & 63 of the Constitution, as they are no more Sadiq and 
Ameen.  In  support  of  his  submission,  petitioner  has  referred  to 
settlement  agreement  dated  18.12.2017,  executed  between  M/s. 
Malik  Ghee  and  Bank  of  Punjab  /  respondent  No.3.  Whereas 
respondents    have  disputed  the  above  assertions  of  petitioner  by 
submitting  that  petitioner  did  not  exhaust  alternate  remedy  of 
approaching  respondent-ECP;  that  petitioner  did  not  agitate  the 
matter  at  the  time  of  filing  of  nomination  papers;  that  similar 
petition filed by petitioner before respondent-ECP has already been 
withdrawn; that finance facilities were fully secured by furnishing 
guarantees  and  respondents  are  not  un-discharged  insolvents;  that 
present petitions are the result of mala fide and personal grudge of 
previous  litigation  between  the  parties;  that  bank  guarantees  are 
not  liability  until  default  of  principal  debtor  is  established  and 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
8 
declared  by  a  decree  issued  by  a  Court  of  law;  that  respondents 
disclosed their share-holdings in nomination papers; and that as the 
companies  are  separate  legal  entities,  therefore,  no  office  / 
designation held in such companies or liabilities of such companies 
was required to be mentioned and the provisions of Articles 62 & 
63  of  the  Constitution  are  not  attracted  in  case  of  respondent 
Muhammad Razzaq Malik, as held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in 
Zahid Iqbal v. Hafiz Muhammad Adnan and others (2016 SCMR 
430) and this Court in the case of Malik Farzand Ali supra. In the 
case  of  Zahid  Iqbal  supra,  the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court  has  held  as 
under:- 
 
.... As noted above, any disqualification within 
“13. 
the  contemplation  of  Article  62  and  or  63  of  the 
Constitution is neither attracted  by implication  nor by 
reference  within  the  fold  of  section  27  of  the  Act, 
2013,  such  disqualifying  provisions  cannot  be 
dragged  and  be  read  as  a  part  of  section  27  of  the 
Act, 2013.” 
8. 
The  question  which  needs  determination  by  this  Court  is 
whether in the facts and circumstances of these cases, provisions of 
Articles  62  &  63  of  the  Constitution  can  be  invoked  seeking 
disqualification  of  respondents  on  the  above  allegations  in  writ 
jurisdiction.  It  has  also  not  been  shown  to  this  Court  that  at  the 
time  of  filing  of  nomination  papers,  respondents  were  defaulters 
within  the  contemplation  of  Articles  62  &  63  of  the  Constitution 
and  the  law  applicable  thereto.  The  Hon’ble  Apex  Court,  in  the 
case  reported  as  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others  v.  Mian 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and others (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 
644),  while  deciding  the  review  application,  held  that  when  the 
alleged  disqualifications  qua  loan  liability  are  not  floating  on  the 
surface,  then  the  questions  as  to  unpaid  loans  are  disputed 
questions of facts, which could not have been adjudicated upon in 
the  proceedings  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution.  Similarly, 
assertions  made  by  learned  counsel  for  petitioner  qua  dishonest 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
9 
concealment of correct value of assets are not apparent from record 
and  involve  disputed  questions.  So  far  as  the  accounts  of  the 
company are concerned, company is a separate legal person and it 
has  not  been  shown  that  respondents  were  under  legal  duty  to 
disclose  it.  Even  otherwise,  respondents  have  offered  prima  facie 
reasonable  explanation to the  alleged loan  liability  /  concealment. 
Such  explanation,  whether  plausible,  reasonable,  bona  fide  or 
dishonest,  involves  a  detailed  inquiry,  which  ex  facie  cannot  be 
undertaken in the exercise of writ jurisdiction.  
 
The  above  legal  position  is  further  obvious  in  the  case  of 
Murad  Bux  supra,  wherein  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  has  ruled 
that  there  has  to  be  willful  false  or  incorrect  statement.  The 
relevant part is reproduced as under:- 
“7. 
....  As  against  this  if  non-disclosure  about 
pendency  of  a  criminal  case  has  been  made,  for 
which 
the  Petitioner  has  offered  a  reasonably 
plausible explanation, then the affidavit could not be 
considered  as  a  false  or  incorrect  declaration.  It  is 
well settled that the provisions of disqualification of a 
candidate  are  to  be  strictly  construed  in  the  case  in 
hand,  the  disqualification  of  the  Petitioner  is  not  an 
issue.  The  only  issue  is  the  non-discloser  of  the 
pending  criminal  case  in  the  affidavit  before  the 
Returning  Officer  and  whether  such  non-disclosure 
would  be  construed  as  concealment  of  „material 
particulars‟. We, in the backdrop of these facts, are of 
the considered view that the non-disclosure of a fact 
which  otherwise,  if  disclosed,  could  not  debar  the 
Petitioner  from  contesting  the  election,  cannot  be 
made  a  ground  to  preclude  the  petitioner  from 
contesting the election.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
9. 
Law on the subject has elaborately been developed till now 
and in a recent pronouncement of Hon’ble Supreme Court, certain 
criteria have been laid down in order to invoke said provisions of 
law.  Element  of  dishonesty 
is  an  essential  element  of 
disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, and the 
person  should  be  found  involved  in  dishonesty  and  cheating  in 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
10 
order  to  attract  the  afore-referred  provision  of  law  as  held  in  the 
case  of  Muhammad  Hanif  Abbasi  supra  (PLD  2018  Supreme 
Court  189), wherein  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court has  emphasized 
that  dishonesty  cannot  be  attributed  without  reference  to  any 
alleged  design,  intention,  scheme,  background  or  impropriety  / 
mens rea. In the afore-referred case, one of the Hon’ble Members 
of  the  Full  Bench,  while  recording  his  additional  note,  made  the 
following observations:- 
the 
term 
“11. 
It  may  be  clarified  here  that  dishonesty  can 
be attributed to a member for an act committed prior 
to  his  election  if  he  has  been  so  adjudicated  by  a 
court of law. This is the mandate of Article 62(1)(f) of 
the  Constitution  which  reads  ‘A  person  shall  not  be 
qualified  to  be  elected  or  chosen  as  a  Member  of 
Majlis-e-Shoora  (Parliament)  unless-…..(f)  he 
is 
sagacious,  righteous,  non-profligate,  honest  and 
ameen, there being no declaration to the contrary by 
a  court  of  law.’  The  last  phrase  of  Article  62(1)(f)  is 
clearly  intended  to  mean  that  where  a  member  is 
attributed  to  be  financially  corrupt  before  he  has 
entered the arena to contest election for a seat in the 
National or Provincial Assembly then the complainant 
must demonstrate without any ambiguity that such a 
member  has  been  declared  by  a  court  of  law  to  be 
financially  dishonest.  Thus 
„honest‟ 
contained in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution has to 
be  interpreted in  a  restricted  sense  keeping  the last 
phrase  of  Article  62(1)(f)  in  mind  which  states  there 
being  no  declaration  to  the  contrary  by  a  court  of 
law.’ If the application of these provisions is stretched 
beyond this, a political opponent in his desire to seek 
removal of his rival from the political scene would call 
in question an asset owned by his opponent that was 
though  acquired  not  only  prior  to  his  becoming  a 
member of the National or a Provincial Assembly but 
even prior to his holding any public office or for that 
matter any office of trusteeship or in his capacity as 
custodian  of  rights  of  others.  Where  a  member  has 
failed to declare an asset in his nomination form that 
was  acquired  prior  to  his  election  and  there  is  no 
adjudication  of  dishonesty  with 
its 
acquisition by a competent court of law, the remedy 
provided  under  the  election  laws  is  to  be  availed, 
which  only  entails  rejection  of  the  nomination  form 
simpliciter.  Once  such  remedy  relating  to  such 
category  of  non-disclosure  is  availed  under  the 
provisions of election laws or the time to avail it has 
regard 
to 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
11 
gone  by, 
the  same  being  not  a  case  of 
disqualification  falling  within  the  ambit  of  Article 
62(1)(f)  of  the  Constitution,  no  more  remains  a  live 
issue on  account of the bar contained in Article 225 
of the Constitution.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
 
10. 
It  is  evident  from  the  above  that  a  non-disclosure  sans  an 
element  of  design,  scheme  or  intent  would  also  not  make  a 
candidature open to be questioned if it could be shown that it was a 
bona fide error and that there was no intention to gain any benefit 
by  withholding  such  information  from  the  constituents.  The 
scrutiny  for  the  purposes of  Article 62(1)(f)  of the  Constitution is 
not based on moralistic or subjective criterion. The said condition 
does  not  contemplate  perfection  but  in  simple  words  requires  a 
person  to  be  honest,  reliable  and  trustworthy.  To  err  is  human 
instinct,  which  might  not  be  highlighted  especially  when  the 
liability was settled and compromise decree was passed. It is also 
to be noted that here the ground for seeking disqualification under 
Article 63 of the Constitution was that a member did not qualify at 
the  time  of  filing  his  nomination  papers,  but  such  fact  was 
discovered  subsequently,  which  was  also  removed  by  payment 
before approaching the Court.   
11.  Learned counsel for petitioner made reference to the cases of 
Imran  Ahmad  Khan  Niazi  (PLD  2017  Supreme  Court  265), 
Imran Ahmed Khan and others (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 692), 
Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz Sharif and  others  (PLD  2018  Supreme 
Court  1)  and  Muhammad  Hanif  Abbasi  (PLD  2018  Supreme 
Court 114) supra to contend that the element of strict liability is to 
be followed. Suffice it to say that the Hon’ble Apex Court, in Civil 
Appeal  No.467  of  2015  titled  Malik  Shakil  Awan  v.  Sheikh 
Rasheed  Ahmed  and  others,  has  held  that  in  the  afore-referred 
cases,  it  was  established,  in  fact,  admitted,  that  the  assets  owned 
were not mentioned in the nomination papers and no explanation in 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
12 
this behalf  was  offered. In this  case,  neither  default  nor  dishonest 
concealment  of  assets  has  been  established  but  settlement  and 
payment  has  also  been  admitted.  There  are  disputed  questions  of 
facts  as  to  default  of  respondents,  involved  in  these  cases, 
therefore,  the  afore-referred  case  law  qua  applicability  of  rule  of 
strict  liability  and  jurisprudence  is  not  attracted  in  the  given  facts 
and  circumstances  of  the  case.  This  is  further  affirmed  by  the 
Hon’ble Apex Court in Khawaja Mohammad Asif’s case, whereby 
judgment    /  order  dated  26.04.2018,  passed  by  learned  Islamabad 
High Court, Islamabad, disqualifying the respondent therein on the 
ground  of  certain  alleged  concealment  /  non-disclosure,  was  set 
aside (detailed reasons are yet to be released). It is also relevant to 
observe  here 
that  election 
laws  have  more  particular 
disqualification  provisions  to  disenfranchising  a  candidate,  thus, 
depriving  him  of  a  valuable  right  of  franchise  /  representation  of 
people  after  election,  guaranteed  under  the  Constitution  is  to  be 
strictly construed and any ambiguity is to be resolved in favour of 
candidate.  Any  benefit  of  doubt  has  to  be  given  to  the  candidate 
after  election  and  higher  standards  of  proofs  are  required  for 
proving  dishonesty.  Reliance 
is  placed  upon 
the  case  of 
Muhammad Mujtaba Abdullah supra. 
12.  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  contended  that  any  error  or 
omission in the declaration of assets / liabilities by a candidate for 
election  or  a  legislator  incurs  his  disqualification  under  the  afore-
referred  provisions  of  law  posits  a  wide  proposition  of  law.  If  at 
all,  this  may  have  limited  relevance  where  the  context  involves 
corruption or money laundering in state office, misappropriation of 
public  property  or  public  funds,  accumulation  of  assets  beyond 
known  means  or  abuse  of  public  office  or  authority  for  private 
gain. These allegations are not germane to the present cases. There 
is  no  involvement  of  public  property  or  funds,  abuse  of  public 
office and authority, corruption or breach of fiduciary duty in these 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
13 
matters.  Even  otherwise,  as  observed  supra:  (i)  this  Court  cannot 
hold  with  certainty  whether  liability  /  information  concealed  was 
intentional,  dishonest,  serious  or  substantial 
in  nature  and 
recording  of  evidence 
is  required.  Reference 
is  made 
to 
Muhammad  Younus  Khan  and  12  others  v.  Government  of  N.-
W.F.P.  through  Secretary,  Forest and  Agriculture,  Peshawar  and 
others  (1993  SCMR  618),  Secretary  to  the  Government  of  the 
Punjab,  Forest  Department,  Punjab,  Lahore  through  Divisional 
Forest Officer v. Ghulam Nabi and 3 others (PLD 2001 Supreme 
Court  415),    Anjuman  Fruit  Arhtian  and  others  v.  Deputy 
Commissioner, Faisalabad and others (2011 SCMR 279) and Rai 
Hassan  Nawaz  v.  Haji  Muhammad  Ayub  and  others  (PLD  2017 
Supreme  Court  70);  (ii)  petitioner  himself  concealed  and 
suppressed  availing  of  alternate  remedy  before  respondent-ECP. 
He  who  seeks  equity,  must  come  to  the  Court  with  clean  hands. 
Reliance  is  placed  on  Abdul  Rasheed  and  another  v.  Election 
Appellate Authority and others (2016 SCMR 1215), Abdul Rahim 
Khan  v.  Town  Committee,  Makhdoompur  Pahooran  and  others 
(1985  CLC  2805)  and  Rao  Tariq  Mehmood  v.  Election  Tribunal, 
Punjab, Lahore and another (PLD 2003 Lahore 169); (iii) During 
pendency  of  this  petition,  05-years’  term  of  respondent  Malik 
Muhammad  Nawaz,  MPA  stood  completed  and  the  Provincial 
Assembly of the Punjab was dissolved on and from 31.05.2018 in 
terms  of  Article  107  of  the  Constitution.  Even  otherwise,  at  the 
time  of  filing  of  nomination  papers,  no  such  objections  were 
raised;  (iv)  in  case  of  respondent  Muhammad  Razzaq  Malik, 
disqualification  within  the  contemplation  of  Articles  62  &  63  of 
the  Constitution  was  neither  attracted  by  implication  nor  by 
reference  within  the  fold  of  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Act, 
2013.  Reference  is  made  to  the  cases  of  Zahid  Iqbal  and  Malik 
Farzand  Ali  supra;  (v)  there  is  a  series  of  litigation  between  the 
parties  and  bona  fides  of  petitioner  are  questionable;  (vi) 
explanation offered by the respondents, whether reasonable or not, 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
14 
cannot be determined with certainty at this stage; (vii) discovery, if 
any as to loan / liability and alleged concealment, was made after 
filing  of  nomination  papers  and  same  was  settled  before 
approaching  this  Court;  and  (viii)  liberal  approach  has  to  be 
adopted as per the latest view of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the 
cases  of  Muhammad  Hanif  Abbasi  (PLD  2018  Supreme  Court 
189), Malik Shakil Awan, Khawaja Mohammad Asif supra and this 
Court  in  Muhammad  Ashraf  and  others  v.  Additional  District 
Judge  /  Appellate  Authority,  R.Y.Khan  and  others  (2018  YLR 
173). Consequently, the argument of learned counsel for petitioner, 
on  these  scores,  fails.  The  case  law  cited  by  learned  counsel  for 
petitioner is on distinguishable facts and circumstances, therefore, 
same is not applicable.  
13. 
It  is  also  relevant  to  observe  here  that  there  is  a  series  of 
litigation between the parties as highlighted by learned counsel for 
respondents,  during  the  course  of  arguments,  and  petitioner  has 
already  approached  the  respondent-ECP  through  a  petition. 
However,  later  on,  it  was  withdrawn  and  this  fact  has  not  been 
disclosed  by  petitioner  in  the  instant  petition,  which  clearly 
militates  against  bona  fide  of  petitioner.  Even  otherwise,  grant  of 
relief  in  writ  jurisdiction  is  a  matter  of  discretion,  wherein  it  is 
quite legitimate on the part of High Court to test the bona fides of 
the  relator  to  see  if  he  has  come  with  clean  hands.  A  writ  of  quo 
warranto  in  particular  cannot  be  issued  as  a  matter  of  course  on 
sheer technicalities on a doctrinaire approach.  
Similarly, in the case of Aurangzeb Shaafi Burki supra, this 
Court has given the following observations:- 
“12. 
There  is  no  cavil  to  the  proposition  that  the 
Constitutional  remedy  is  a  discretionary  particularly 
the  relief  claimed  on  the  principle  governing  quo 
warranto  as  envisaged  under  Article  199(2)(b)(ii)  of 
the  Constitution.  Such  a  discretion  has 
to  be 
exercised  by  this  Court  in  accordance  with  the 
judicial  principles  and  not  as  a  matter  of  course.  In 
W.P. No.133237 of 2018 & connected case 
 
15 
order to exercise such a discretion the conduct of the 
petitioner  is  very  relevant.  The  present  Writ  Petition 
is  based  on  mala  fides  and  is  an  act  motivated  for 
ulterior  considerations  designed 
to  malign  and 
scandalize the  respondents as the petitioner,  as  per 
his own admission, in the Writ Petition, is a, political 
worker  serving  as  Secretary  Finance  of  Pakistan 
Peoples Party (Punjab), as such, he is not entitled to 
any discretionary relief.”  
 
14. 
It  is  well  settled  that  an  aggrieved  person  has  to  resort  to 
statutory  remedy  as  provided  under  the  relevant  statute  and  must 
not  invoke  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  in  terms  of 
Article 199 of the Constitution in a routine matter. Such remedy is 
discretionary  in  nature  and  has  to  be  exercised  in  favour  of  the 
aggrieved  person  in  extreme  circumstances  in  a  case  having  its 
own peculiar facts and circumstances. Its object is to foster justice 
in aid of justice and not to perpetuate injustice, therefore, the Court 
is  not  inclined  to  interfere  at  this  stage.  Resultantly,  instant 
petition, along with connected petition, is dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
