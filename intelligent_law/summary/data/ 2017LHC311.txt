This  revision  petition  is  of  the  plaintiff 
 
and  arises  from  a  suit  for  possession  of  the 
disputed  property  through  pre-emption.  This  suit 
was  contested  by  the  respondent.  On  pleadings 
issues  were  framed  and  parties  were  directed  to 
adduce  evidence  in  support  of  their  respective 
claims. The petitioner/pre-emptor  despite availing 
numerous  opportunities 
could  not  produce 
evidence  and, thus,  the  learned  Trial  Court  closed 
his  right  to  produce  evidence.  The  suit  was 
dismissed  for  want  of  evidence  vide  decree  dated 
12.02.2014.  The  petitioner  assailed  the  decree  of 
the  learned  Trial  Court  through  an  appeal  before 
the  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Phalia.  It 
was  pleaded  before  the  learned  first  Appellate 
Court  that  another  case  having  the  same  title  i.e. 
Arshad  vs.  Nawaz  was  also  pending  on 
15.01.2014,  which  was  adjourned  to  13.02.2014

CR. No.3543-14 
and, therefore, the petitioner misconstrued that his 
suit,  from  which  instant  revision  petition  arises, 
also adjourned to 13.02.2014; and, that due to said 
reason  neither  petitioner  nor  his  counsel  could 
appear  before 
the 
learned  Trial  Court 
  on 
12.02.2014  the  date  fixed  in  his  suit  and  on  the 
said date his right to produce evidence was closed. 
This  argument  did  not  prevail  upon  the  learned 
first  Appellate  Court  as  the  same  was  found 
contrary  to  the  record.  The  appeal  was,  therefore, 
dismissed vide decree dated 09.07.2014.  
2.  
The  petitioner  through  this  petition  seeks 
revision  of  the  afore  noted  decrees  of  the  learned 
Courts  below.  Since  this  petition  was  not  filed 
within prescribed period of 90 days, the petitioner 
has  filed  an  application  (i.e.  C.M.  No.02 of  2014) 
for  condonation  of  delay.  The  petitioner  has  also 
filed an application (i.e. C.M.No.1 of 2014) under 
section 151 CPC for grant of interim relief.  
3.  
The  prime  question  for  consideration  in 
this petition is whether the learned Trial Court had 
rightly exercised its jurisdiction while closing right 
of  the  petitioner  to  produce  evidence.  The  answer 
to  this  question  may  be  given  by  examining  the 
proceedings  of  the  learned  Trial  Court.  Summary 
of  the  proceedings  of  the  learned  Trial  Court  has 
been given by  the learned  first  Appellate Court in 
 
3 
CR. No.3543-14 
paragraph 4 of its judgment dated 09.07.2014. The 
facts  recorded  in  paragraph  4  are  in  consonance 
with order sheet of the learned Trial Court which is 
available on this file as Annex-D. Thus, in order to 
avoid  any  repetition,  paragraph  4  of  the  appellate 
judgment dated 09.07.2014 is reproduced below: 
“  The  case  was  adjourned  for  recording  of 
evidence  on  11.1.2012  when  evidence  was  not 
available, 
then 
the  case  was  adjourned 
to 
10.3.2012  when  an  application  was  filed  and 
subsequent  dates  7.4.2012,  26.4.2012,  23.5.2012 
fixed for reply and order on the application. Then 
again case was fixed for recording of evidence. On 
10.7.2012  evidence  was  not  available,  then  the 
case  adjourned  to  12.8.2012.  On  the  said  date 
position  was  same,  then  the  case  was  adjourned 
for  7.11.2012  when  the  witnesses  were  present, 
however  learned  counsel  was  not  ready  for  cross 
examination  when  case  was  adjourned 
for 
8.12.2012.  On 
the  said  date  evidence  was 
available.  The  case  was  adjourned  for  19.1.2013 
on  the  said  date  evidence  was  not  available  and 
again  case  was  adjourned  to  13.3.2013.  On  the 
said  date  evidence  was  available  but  learned 
defence  counsel  was  not  present.  Then  case  was 
adjourned 
for  17.4.2013.  On 
the  said  date 
evidence  was  not  available,  then  the  case  was 
adjourned  for  13.5.2013,  14.6.2013,  10.7.2013, 
11.9.2013, 23.10.2013, 20.11.2013, 15.1.2014 and 
23.1.2014.  On  all  dates  the  evidence  was  not 
available.  On  23.1.2014  the  learned  trial  court 
extended final and last opportunity for production 
of evidence and case was adjourned for 8.2.2014. 
On  the  date  again  last  and  final  opportunity  was 
extended  and  case  was  adjourned  for  12.2.2014 
 
4 
CR. No.3543-14 
when  right  was  struck  off  under  Order  17  rule  3 
CPC.”    
4. 
Perusal  of  the  above  cited  paragraph  and 
proceedings  of  the  learned  Trial  Court  leads  to 
conclusion  that  learned  Trail  Court  showed  extra 
ordinary  indulgence  in  the  matter  and  granted 
adequate opportunities to the petitioner to produce 
evidence in support of his claim. The benevolence 
shown  by 
the 
learned  Trial  Court  was 
misconstrued by the petitioner. In fact the conduct 
of the petitioner was not only carefree or negligent 
but  also  contumacious.  The  petitioner  neither 
before  the  learned  Courts  below  nor  in  the 
memorandum  of  instant  revision  petition  has 
disclosed  any  reason  which  caused  hindrance  in 
his  way  to  produce  evidence  before  the  learned 
Trial  Court    on  14.6.2013,  10.7.2013,  11.9.2013, 
23.10.2013,  20.11.2013,  15.1.2014,  23.1.2014, 
8.2.2014    and  12.2.2014.  After  examining  the 
record of the case, I am of the view that the learned 
Trial Court was confronted with a situation  where 
the  petitioner  was  not  ready  with  his  evidence.  In 
these  attending  circumstances, learned  Trial  Court 
while  proceeding  with  the  suit  under  sub-rule  (3) 
of  Rule  1  of  Order  XVII  CPC  could  close  his 
evidence so as to get to the next stage in the trial. 
This  is  what  the  learned  Trial  Court  precisely  did 
 
5 
CR. No.3543-14 
in the present case. The citation of the Order XVII 
Rule  3  CPC  in  judgment  dated  12.02.2014  does 
not  make  any  difference  because  substance  of  the 
said  judgment  shows  that  the  learned  Trial  Court 
meant  to  close  the  evidence  under  Order  XVII 
Rule 1 (3) CPC. Accordingly I hold that evidence 
of  the  petitioner  was  rightly  closed.  In  arriving  at 
this conclusion I stand fortified from the judgment 
rendered in the cases of Pirzada Amir Hssan and 
others  v  Mrs.  Shamim  Shah  Nawaz  and  others 
(1984  CLC  3080)  and  The  Administrator, 
Lahore  Municipal  Corporation,  Lahore  v 
Abdul Hamid and others  (1987 CLC 1261). 
5. 
Another  aspect  of 
the  matter  which 
dissuaded  me  to  interfere  with  the  concurrent 
findings  of  the  learned  Courts  below  is  delay  in 
filing revision petition. Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
the  case of  Province  of  Punjab  through District 
Officer  Revenue  Rawalpindi  and  others  v 
Muhammad Sarwar (2014 SCMR 1358) has held 
that  where  an  aggrieved  party  seeks  redressal 
against 
the 
judgment  or  order 
through 
the 
revisional  powers  of  the  Court  under  Section  115 
CPC,  he  has  ninety  days  to  make  the  petition, 
failing which the petition is liable to be dismissed. 
On being confronted with the said principle of law, 
learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that  the 
 
6 
CR. No.3543-14 
petitioner  on  11.08.2014  applied  for  obtaining 
certified  copy  of  the  impugned  decree  dated 
09.07.2014;  that  the  petitioner  had  been  regularly 
visiting  the  copying  branch  for  obtaining  certified 
copy of the decree but the same  was delayed; that 
the certified copy of the decree which though was 
prepared  on  11.08.2014  but    was  delivered  to  the 
petitioner on 01.11.2014; and, that after getting the 
certified  copy  of 
the 
impugned  decree, 
the 
petitioner  filed  revision  petition  before  this  Court 
on  25.11.2014.  On  the  basis  of  said  facts  he 
contends  that  revision  petition  is  not  barred  by 
time;  and,  that  since  office  had  raised  objection, 
the  petitioner  filed  an  application  (C.M.No.2  of 
2014) for condonation of delay. He requests that if 
there  is  any  delay,  same  may  be  condoned  on  the 
basis of afore stated facts. 
6. 
The  afore  noted  arguments  sans  merit. 
The  relevant  provision  governing  the  above  said 
argument is proviso to section 115 (1) CPC which 
reads as under:    
  “Provided  that,  where  a  person  makes  an 
application  under  this  subsection,  he  shall,  in 
support of such application, furnish copies of the 
pleadings,  documents  and  order  of 
the 
subordinate  Court,  and  the  High  Court  shall, 
except for reasons to be recorded, dispose of such 
application  without  calling  for  the  record  of  the 
subordinate Court. 
 
7 
CR. No.3543-14 
 Provided  that  such  application  shall  be  made 
with  ninety  days  of 
the  decision  of 
the 
Subordinate Court which shall provide a copy of 
such  decision  within  three  days  thereof,  and  the 
High  Court  shall  dispose  of  such  application 
within three months.” 
7. 
The above cited provision of law makes it 
obligatory for the petitioner to furnish copies of the 
pleadings, documents and order of the subordinate 
Court  along  with  revision  petition.  The  word 
“certified” is absent in the above proviso to section 
115 (1) CPC. Inference from the omission of word 
“certified”  clearly  absolves  the  petitioner  from 
filing  certified  copies  of  the  impugned  judgments 
etc.  along  with  revision  petition.  Approaching  the 
Copying  Agency  for  obtaining  certified  copy  of 
the  impugned  judgment,  therefore,  would  not  in 
any manner extend the benefit of section 12 of the 
Limitation  Act  to  the  petitioner.  The  second 
proviso to section 115 (1) CPC makes it obligatory 
for the subordinate Court to provide a copy of the 
impugned decision within three days thereof. Here 
again  there  is  no  requirement  of  law  that  such  a 
copy shall be a certified copy. It was, thus, duty of 
the  petitioner  to  have  approached  the  lower  Court 
which  passed  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree 
to  obtain  copy  of  the  same.  Once  the  application 
was  made  to  the  subordinate  Court  and  there  was 
failure  of  the  lower  Court  to  provide  copy  within 
 
8 
CR. No.3543-14 
prescribed period of three days, revision petitioner 
could  have  sought  condonation  of  delay  on  the 
ground  that  it  was  beyond  his  control  to  obtain  a 
copy from the lower forum. It is not the case of the 
petitioner  that  he  filed  an  application  before  the 
learned  subordinate  Court  for  compliance  of 
mandate of second proviso to section 115 (1) CPC 
and,  therefore,  the  petitioner  cannot  be  held 
entitled  to  get  the  benefit  of  section  12  of  the 
Limitation  Act  for  the  time  spent  in  obtaining 
certified  copy  of  impugned  decree  from  Copying 
Agency.  In  this  regard  reliance  is  placed  on  the 
cases  of  Said  Muhammad  v  Sher  Muhammad 
and 2 others (2001 MLD 1546) and Sultan Khan 
and 3 others v Sultan Khan (2004 MLD 918). 
8. 
In  view  of  above,  prayer  made 
in 
C.M.No.02 of 2014 as well as in the main revision 
petition cannot be granted. Thus, prayer for interim 
relief also cannot be granted.  
9. 
In the sequel, revision petition along with 
C.M.No.1  of  2014  and  C.M.No.2  of  2014  are 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
