Through  the  instant  petition,  filed  under 
Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 
Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  (the  “Constitution”),  the 
Petitioner  has  challenged  the  legality  of  impugned 
orders  dated  14.04.2017,  19.04.2017  and  03.12.2018 
passed by the Respondents.

3.   
Feeling  aggrieved  thereby  the  Petitioner 
filed  W.P.  No.31900/2017  which  was  disposed  of 
vide  order  dated  14.06.2017  with  the  direction  to  the

Respondent  No.5-Ombudsperson  who  modified  the 
order  of 
the  competent  authority  with  certain 
modifications  vide  order  dated  03.12.2018.  Being 
dissatisfied from the same, the Petitioner filed another 
W.P.  No.6040/19  which  was  disposed  of  on 
01.02.2019 with the direction to the Petitioner to avail 
appropriate  remedy.  In  pursuance  of  which  the

            3 
Petitioner  preferred  an  Appeal  before  the  Governor, 
Punjab  who  disposed  of  the  same  vide  order  dated 
20.02.2019 being not maintainable before him. Hence, 
this petition.  
II.  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONER 
4.   
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia 
submitted  that  the  impugned  orders  are  illegal  and 
against  the  law  and  facts;  that  no  opportunity  of 
personal  hearing  has  been  afforded  to  the  Petitioner, 
as such he has been condemned unheard; that the Act 
was  not  applicable  to  the  case  of  the  Petitioner;  that 
the  Petitioner  was  entangled  on  the  basis  of  jealousy 
by  the  Respondent  No.7  and  others;  that  vide  the 
impugned orders dated 14.04.2017 and 19.04.2017 the 
Petitioner has  been subjected to double jeopardy.  
III.    SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
5.   
On  the  other  hand  learned  Law  Officer  
vehemently  opposed    the  arguments  advanced  by  the 
learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  and  prayed  for 
dismissal of the petition at limine stage by stating that 
after  proper  inquiry  the  Petitioner  has  been  found  
guilty  of  sexual  harassment  as  such  has  rightly  been 
awarded  major  penalty;  that  the  Petitioner  is  an 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            4 
Assistant Professor and the victim is his student and if 
such like acts/conducts are not curbed with iron hands 
the dignity and prestige of the female students would 
become toy at the hands of the teachers; that the act of 
sexual harassment is a great stigma on the relationship 
of teacher and a student; that the major punishment to 
the  delinquents  by  the  Departments  in  such  like  
offences  would  create  an  atmosphere  of  safety  of 
respect amongst the female students.  
6.   
I have heard the arguments of both the sides 
and perused the record. 
 
IV. 
MOOT POINTS 
7.   
Keeping in view the prayer of the Petitioner, 
arguments  on  his  behalf  as  well  as  the  available 
record, following moot points are here framed: 
I. 
Whether the Respondents were justified to 
impose penalty of removal from service 
against the Petitioner, under the Act? 
II.  Whether    the  Respondents  were  justified  to

V.  
NUB OF THE MATTER 
8.   
The  Petitioner  was  serving  as  Assistant 
Professor  in  the  Respondent  No.2‟s  University  and 
was  also  a  student  of  Doctorate  in  Institute  of 
Molecular  Biology  and  Bio  Technology 
in  the 
University  of  Lahore.  A  complaint  of  sexual 
harassment  was  lodged  against  the  Petitioner  by  the 
Respondent  No.7  who  is  his  student  alleging  therein 
that  the  Petitioner  harassed  her  sexually  by  way  of 
sending her vulgar text messages on Whatsapp while  
she  was  asking  about  subject  cell  and  tissue  culture; 
he  forced  her  to  visit  his  bachelor  accommodation 
and  cook food for him; she also alleged that being a 
G.R.  when  she  was  inquiring  from  him  about  the 
status of class result, he starting conversation relating 
to  sex  and  showed  his  intention  of  having  sex  with 
her; 
that  some  other  girls  also 
faced  sexual 
harassment by the Petitioner. An inquiry was initiated 
and  the  Petitioner  was  dismissed  from  service  under 
the  Protection  Against  Harassment  of  Women  at  the 
Workplace  (Amendment)  Act,  2012  and  was  also 
expelled from the University of Lahore as a student of

No.DBT02131001,  Institute  of  Molecular  Biology 
and  Biotechnology.  The  Petitioner  preferred  an 
Appeal  before  the  Respondent  No.5-Ombudsperson 
who  modified  the  order  of  the  competent  authority 
with 
certain  modifications  vide  order  dated 
03.12.2018 and converted the penalty from “dismissal 
from service” to “removal from service”.  
Moot Point-I 
Whether the respondents were justified to impose 
penalty  of  removal  from  service  against  the 
petitioner, under the act? 
 
9.   
The  work  environment  for  women,  in  a 
male-dominated society like Pakistan, is often hostile 
and  antagonistic  hindering  their  contribution  to  their 
country‟s  development  as  well  as  their  right  to 
employment.  Various  studies  have  found  that  social 
constraints  and  an  aggressive  work  environment 
discourage 
women 
from 
seeking 
employment. Therefore, 
the  Protection 
against 
Harassment  of  Women  at  Workplace  Act,  2010  (as 
amended  by 
the  Punjab  Protection  Against 
Harassment 
of  Women 
at 
the  Workplace 
(Amendment)  Act,  2012)  (the  “Act”)  was  passed  in 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            7 
March  2010  to  make  provisions  for  the  protection 
against  harassment  of  women  at  the  workplace.  The 
objective  of  this  act  is  to  create  a  safe  working 
environment 
for  women,  which 
is 
free 
from 
harassment,  abuse  and  intimidation  to  facilitate  their 
right  to  work  with  dignity.  It  will  also  enable  higher 
productivity and a better quality of life at work. Under 
section  2(h)  the  term  „harassment‟  is  defined  as 
“harassment  means  any  unwelcome  sexual  advance, 
request  for  sexual  favors  or  other  verbal  or  written 
communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature 
or  sexually  demeaning  attitudes,  causing  interference 
with  work  performance  or  creating  an  intimidating, 
hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt 
to punish the complainant for refusal to comply such a 
request or is made a condition for employment”. 
10.  
It  is  also  our  constitutional  duty  to  protect 
women to ensure their full participation in all spheres 
of  national  life.  The  relevant  provisions  of  the 
Constitution, 1973 are reproduced hereunder for ready 
reference: - 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            8 
“25.  Equality  of  citizens.--  (1)  All  citizens  are 
equal  before  law  and  are  entitled  to  equal 
protection of law. 
(2) There shall be no discrimination on the basis of 
sex. 
(3) Nothing in this article to prevent the state from 
making  any  special  provisions  for  protection  of 
women and children. 
 
34.  Full  participation  of  women  in  national  life.—
Steps  shall  be  taken  to  ensure  full  participation  of 
women in all sphere of national life.” 
11.  
The  above 
referred  Articles  of 
the 
Constitution  alongwith  Article  14  provides  every 
citizen male or female the right of self-respect, dignity 
and prestige and the Constitution has also guaranteed 
that steps shall be taken to ensure full participation of 
women  in  all spheres  of  national life.  Under  the  Act, 
the protection to the women from being exploited and 
harassed  at  work  place  has  been  provided.  The 
preamble  of  the  Act  clearly  states  that  it  has  been 
made for the protection against harassment of women 
at the workplace. It also reflects that the Constitution 
recognizes the fundamental right of citizens to dignity 
of person. It is the right of every woman in Pakistan to 
be  recognized  and  has  equal  protection  of  law.  This 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            9 
Court in case titled Subay Khan v. Secretary, Labour 
Government of the Punjab (PLD 2019 Lahore 253)  
has held as under: 
“24.  A Right is a power, privilege, faculty, 
or  demand,  inherent  in  one  person  and 
incident  upon  another.  Rights  can be  moral 
or  legal.  Along  with  legal  rights  there  exist 
moral rights as well, which in general have 
subjective  support  while  legal  rights  have 
the  objective  support  of  the  State.  Legal 
right is an interest, which is recognized and 
protected by  the  rule  of  legal  justice.  Every 
right has interests but all interests cannot be 
rights.  Statues  made  by  the  State  doesn’t 
really  give  rights  but  in  contrary  deprives 
citizens  from  certain  rights  because  all 
citizens  are  born  with  rights,  Governments 
through  such  statues  control  the  behaviors 
of individuals by drawing perimeters around 
those  rights  citizens  possess  by  birth.  The 
law  may 
provide  mechanism 
for 
enforcement of right but the existence of the 
right  does  not  depend  upon  the  creation  of 
such  mechanism.  The  right  exists  prior  to 
and 
independent  of 
the  mechanism  of 
enforcement. It is quite obvious that unless a 
right is recognized by the State it would not 
have  any  validity  or  weight  to  be  imposed 
upon others. Hence, this right has just been 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            10 
recognized  by  the  Government  and  will  be 
protected  by 
the  Government  and 
the 
Judiciary.” 
 
12.  
In  view  of  the  above,  the  protection  of 
women  from  being  harassed  at  the  workplace  is 
already  enshrined  under  the  Constitution  and  was 
given  under  the  Act  and  protected  by  the  Executive 
and Judiciary. Moreover, this Act is not confined only 
to the relationship of an  employer and employee; but 
it extends  to all acts of sexual harassment committed 
by  employer  or  employee  with  any  women  (at    the 
workplace)  by  misusing/exploiting  his/her  official  
position/capacity.  As 
in 
the 
instant  case, 
the 
Petitioner/teacher/employee  used  his  official  position 
to sexually exploit his female student. The intention of 
the  legislature  for  enacting  the  Act  to  protect  all 
employees  from  being  harassed  or  exploited  during 
employment  which  can  be  at  the  workplace  or  any 
environment as specified in their terms and conditions 
of    the  employment.    Section    2    (f)    clearly    states  
that  employee  means  a  regular  or  contractual 
employee  whether  employed  on  daily,  weekly, 
monthly or hourly basis, and includes an intern or an 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            11 
apprentice.  The  employer  includes  all  persons  who 
employees workers under contract or any manner. The 
workplace  defines  under  Section  2  (n)  which  clearly 
states  that  any  place  of  work  which  includes  any 
situation  that  is  linked  to  official  work  or  official 
activity outside the office. This means that any worker 
whoever is employed in any  manner or capacity with 
the  employer  is  protected  from  being  harassed.  The 
definition  of  harassment  is  exhaustive  which  has 
already  been  discussed  above  which  also  linked 
within the condition of employment. Therefore, in the 
case in hand  the  Petitioner  was the  employee  as  well 
as 
the  student  of 
the  University  and 
in  his 
employment as teacher he exploited and harassed the 
Respondent  No.7  by  sending  vulgar  messages  on 
Whatsapp for illicit purpose.

JURISPRUDENCE 
SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT ACROSS THE WORLD 
ON 
It is a matter of fact that sexual harassment, 
and  harassment  on  non-gender  discriminatory 
grounds,  pollute  the  working  environment  and  can 
have  a  devastating  effect  on  the  health,  confidence, 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            12 
morale  and  performance  of  those  affected  by  it. 
Commonly, the anxiety and stress produced by sexual 
harassment  and  harassment  may 
lead 
to 
those 
subjected  to  it  taking  time  off  work  due  to  sickness 
and stress, being less efficient at work or leaving their 
job  to  seek  work  elsewhere.  Under  the  jurisprudence 
developed  in  this  matter,  the  employees  often  suffer 
the adverse consequences of the harassment itself and, 
in  addition,  the  short  and  long  term  damage  to  their 
employment  prospects  if  they  are  forced  to  forego 
promotion  or  to  change  jobs.  Henceforth,  the  sexual 
harassment and harassment may also have a damaging 
impact  on  employees  not  themselves  the  object  of 
unwanted  behaviour  but  who  is  witness  to  it  or  has 
knowledge of the unwanted behaviour. Therefore, for 
deciding the instant petition, it would be advantageous 
to make a survey of case law of different jurisdictions 
dealing  with  the  issue  of  harassment  of  women  at 
workplace.   
14.  
Sexual  harassment  of  working-women  was 
first  conceived  as  a  „special  type  of  wrong‟  entitled 
to  legal  remedy  in the  United  States, thirty  years  ago 
by  Catharine  MacKinnon  in  an  article,  Sexual 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            13 
Harassment  of  Working  Women  (New  Haven:  Yale 
University  Press,  1979).  She  made  a  perceptive 
argument  that  sexual  harassment  constitutes  sex 
discrimination  under  Title  VII  of  the  1964  Civil 
Rights  Act.  Congress  had  enacted  Section  703,  Title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act, 1964, to address the issue 
of sexual harassment at the workplace. This provided 
the basis for civil action, and was rapidly assimilated 
into  the  wider  discourse  of  discrimination,  in  the  US 
(Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson (1986) 477 U.S. 57). 
The US Supreme Court in Harris v. Forklift Systems, 
Inc. (1993), 510 U.S. 17, held that:  
"When  the  workplace  is  permeated  with 
discriminatory  intimidation,  ridicule,  and 
insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive 
to  alter 
the  victim's 
employment  and  create  an  abusive  working 
environment, Title VII is violated." 
the  conditions  of 
 
15.  
The US Supreme Court in Joseph Oncale v. 
Sundowner  Offshore  Services,  Inc.  523  U.S.  75 
(1998), (judgment delivered by Justice Scalia) even 
held that behavior deemed offensive could cover same 
sex  intimidation,  ridicules,  or  other  abusive  conduct. 
While  on  the  subject,  it  would  be  interesting  to  note 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            14 
that  the  general  perspective,  which  the  courts  often 
adopt,  in  the  United  States  is  not  the  standard  of  a 
"reasonable  man"  but  the  standard  of  a  "reasonable 
woman"  (Ref.  Ellison  v.  Brady,  (1991)  9th  Circuit, 
924 F.2d, 872). The relevant paras of the judgment are 
reproduced hereunder for ease of reference: -  
"should  consider 
"we  believe  that  in  evaluating  the  severity 
and pervasiveness of sexual harassment, we 
should focus on the perspective of the victim. 
Courts 
the  victim's 
perspective  and  not  stereotyped  notions  of 
acceptable  behavior".  Conduct  that  many 
men  consider  unobjectionable  may  offend 
many women. Men tend to view some forms 
of  sexual  harassment  as  "harmless  social 
interactions  to  which  only  overly-sensitive 
women would object"; the characteristically 
male  view  depicts  sexual  harassment  as 
comparatively harmless amusement.  
We  realise  that  there  is  a  broad  range  of 
viewpoints among women as a group but we 
believe  that  many  women  share  common 
concerns  which  men  do  not  necessarily 
share.  For  example,  because  women  are 
disproportionately  victims  of  rape  and 
sexual  assault,  women  have  a  stronger 
incentive 
to  be  concerned  with  sexual 
behavior.  Women  who  are  victims  of  mild 
forms 
harassment  may 
understandably  worry  whether  a  harasser's 
conduct is merely a prelude to violent sexual 
assault.  Men,  who  are  rarely  victims  of 
sexual assault, may view sexual conduct in a 
vacuum  without  a  full  appreciation  of  the 
sexual

social  setting  or  the  underlying  threat  of 
violence  that  a  woman  may  perceive.  One 
writer explains:  
of 
"Their  greater  physical  and  social 
vulnerability  to  sexual  coercion  can 
make  women  wary 
sexual 
encounters.  Moreover,  American 
women  have  been  raised  in  a  society 
where  rape  and  sex-related  violence 
have  reached  unprecedented  levels, 
and  a  vast  pornography 
industry 
creates  continuous  images  of  sexual 
coercion, objectification and violence. 
Because  of 
inequality  and 
coercion with which it is so frequently 
associated in the minds of women, the 
appearance  of

unexpected  context  or  a  setting  of

anguishing experience."

In order to shield employers from having to 
accommodate  the  idiosyncratic  concerns  of 
the  rare  hyper-sensitive  employee,  we  hold 
that  a  female  plaintiff  states  a  prima  facie 
case 
sexual 
harassment when she alleges conduct which 
a 
reasonable  women  would  consider 
sufficiently  severe  or  pervasive  to  alter  the 
conditions  of  employment  and  create  an 
abusive  working  environment.  Of  course, 
where male employees allege that coworkers 
engage  in  conduct  which  creates  a  hostile 
environment, 
victim's 
perspective  would  be  that  of  a  reasonable 
man.  We  note  that  the  reasonable  victim 
standard  we  adopt  today  classifies  conduct 
as  unlawful  sexual  harassment  even  when 
harassers  do  not  realise  that  their  conduct 
creates  a  hostile  working  environment.  To 
avoid  liability  under  Title  VII,  employers 
the  appropriate 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            16 
may  have  to  educate  and  sensitise  their 
workforce  to  eliminate  conduct  which  a 
reasonable  victim  would  consider  unlawful 
sexual  harassment.  If  sexual  comments  or 
sexual  advances  are  in  fact  welcomed  by 
their  sapient, 
they,  of  course,  do  not 
constitute  sexual  harassment.  Title  VII's 
prohibition  of

employment  does  not  require  a  totally 
desexualized work place.

We cannot say a matter of law that Ellison's 
reaction was idiosyncratic or hypersensitive.  
We  believe  that  a  reasonable  woman  could 
have  had  a  similar  action.  A  reasonable 
woman  could  consider  Gray's  conduct,  as 
alleged  by  Ellison,  sufficiently  severe  and 
pervasive to alter a condition of employment

Lord  Denning  while

(EEC) Ltd v Darby” [[1978] IRLR 27] remarked “the 
persistent  and  unwanted  amorous  advances  by  an 
employer  to  a  female  member  of  staff  would  amount 
to a fundamental breach of the implied term of mutual

Several other  countries  have drawn  up laws 
against  sexual  harassment,  oftentimes  based  on 
substantially  different  models  of  unwelcome  and

In  2016,  the  Experts  at  the  International 
Labour  Conference,  through  their  extensive  and 
wide  range  discussions,  observed  that  the  violence 
and harassment in the world of work is unacceptable 
and, indeed, incompatible with decent work and that it 
must  be  addressed.  They,  therefore,  concluded  as 
follow: - 
“the  violence  and  harassment  is  a  human 
right  issue  and  affects  workplace  relations, 
worker  engagement,  health,  productivity, 
quality  of  public  and  private  services,  and 
enterprise  reputation.  It  affects 
labour 
market participation and, in particular, may 
prevent  women  from  entering  the  labour 
market, especially in male-dominated sector 
and 
therein.  It  may

that 
enactment  of  such  legislation  will  take 
considerable 
time.  It 
is  necessary  and 
expedient  for  employers  in  work  places  as 
well  as  other  responsible  persons  or 
institutions  to  observe  certain  guidelines  to 
ensure  the  prevention  of  sexual  harassment 
of women: -  
1.   Duty  of  the  Employer  or  other  responsible 
in  work  places  and  other 
persons 
institutions  
 
It shall be the duty of the employer or 
other responsible persons in work places or 
other  institutions  to  prevent  or  deter  the 
commission  of  acts  of  sexual  harassment 
and  to  provide  the  procedures  for  the 
resolution, settlement or prosecution of acts 
of  sexual  harassment  by  taking  all  steps 
required.  
2.   Definition 
For  this  purpose,  sexual  harassment 
includes 
sexually 
determined behavior (whether directly or by 
implication) as: - 
unwelcome

(b)  a  demand  or  request  for  sexual 
favours; 
(c)  sexually coloured remarks;

(e)  any  other  unwelcome  physical,   
verbal  or  non-verbal  conduct  of 
sexual nature.

Where  any of  these acts is  committed 
in  circumstances  whereunder  the  victim  of 
such 
reasonable 
apprehension that in relation to the victim's 
employment or work whether she is drawing 
salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether 
in  government,  public  or  private  enterprise 
such  conduct  can  be  humiliating  and  may 
constitute a health and safety problem. It is 
discriminatory for instance when the woman 
has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  her 
objection  would  disadvantage  her 
in 
connection  with  her  employment  or  work 
including recruiting or promotion or when it 
creates a hostile work environment. Adverse 
consequences  might  be  visited  if  the  victim 
does  not  consent  to  the  conduct  in  question 
or raises any objection thereto.  
3.  
Preventive Steps:  
 
All employers or persons in charge of 
work place  whether in the public or private 
sector  should  take  appropriate  steps  to 
prevent 
harassment.  Without 
prejudice to the generality of this obligation 
they should take the following steps: - 
sexual 
(a)   Express prohibition of sexual harassment as 
defined  above  at  the  work  place  should  be 
notified,  published  and  circulated 
in 
appropriate ways. 
 
(b)   The  Rules/Regulations  of  Government  and 
Public Sector bodies relating to conduct and 
discipline  should  include  rules/regulations 
prohibiting  sexual  harassment  and  provide 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019

for  appropriate  penalties  in  such  rules 
against the offender.

(d)   Appropriate  work  conditions  should  be 
provided  in  respect  of  work,  leisure,  health 
and  hygiene  to  further  ensure  that  there  is 
no  hostile  environment  towards  women  at 
work places and no employee woman should 
have reasonable grounds to believe that she 
is  disadvantaged  in  connection  with  her 
employment. 
4.   Criminal Proceedings 
Where  such  conduct  amounts  to  a 
specific  offence  under  the  Indian  Penal 
Code  or  under any  other  law,  the  employer 
shall

In  particular,  it  should  ensure  that 
victims  or  witnesses  are  not  victimised  or 
discriminated  against  while  dealing  with 
complaints  of  sexual  harassment.  The 
victims  of  sexual  harassment  should  have 
the option to seek transfer of the perpetrator 
or their own transfer.  
5.   Disciplinary Action 
 
Where  such  conduct  amounts  to  mis-

relevant

10.  Third Party Harassment 
 
Where sexual harassment occurs as a 
result  of  an  act  or  omission  by  any  third 
party  or  outsider,  the  employer  and  person 
in  charge  will  take  all  steps  necessary  and 
reasonable  to  assist  the  affected  person  in

The Supreme Court of India in Rupan Deol 
Bajaj‟s case ((1995)6 SCC 194) held as follow: - 
“More  and  more  girl  students,  women  etc. 
go  to  educational  institutions,  work  places 
etc.  and  their  protection  is  of  extreme 
importance  to  a  civilised  and  cultured 
society.  The  experiences  of  women  and  girl 
children  in  over-crowded  buses,  metros, 
trains  etc.  are  horrendous  and  a  painful 
ordeal.”

The 
Supreme  Court 
of 
India 
in 
S.Samuthiram’s  case  (2013  AIR  (SC)  14)  observed 
that  the  Provisions  of  the  Protection  of  Woman 
against  Sexual  Harassment  at  Workplace  Bill,  2010 
(under consideration of Parliament), which is intended 
to protect female workers in most workplaces are not 
sufficient to curb eve-teasing and to protect the female

at work place; therefore, the Supreme Court issued the 
following  directions  to  Government,  in  the  public 
interest: -  
“(1)   All 
female  police  officers 
the  State  Governments  and  Union 
Territories  are  directed  to  depute  plain 
clothed 
the 
precincts  of  bus-stands  and  stops,  railway 
stations,  metro  stations,  cinema  theatres, 
shopping  malls,  parks,  beaches,  public 
service vehicles, places of worship etc. so as 
to  monitor  and  supervise  incidents  of  eve-
teasing. 
in 
 
(2)   There will be a further direction to the State 
Government and Union Territories to install 
CCTV  in  strategic  positions  which  itself 
would  be  a  deterrent  and  if  detected,  the 
offender could be caught. 
 
(3)   Persons 
in-charge  of 
the  educational 
institutions,  places  of  worship,  cinema 
theatres,  railway  stations,  bus-stands  have 
to take steps as they deem fit to prevent eve-
teasing,  within  their  precincts  and,  on  a 
complaint being made, they must pass on the 
information  to  the  nearest  police  station  or 
the Women's Help Centre. 
 
(4)   Where  any 
incident  of  eve-teasing 
is 
committed in a public service  vehicle either 
by  the  passengers  or  the  persons  in  charge 
of the vehicle, the crew of such vehicle shall, 
on  a  complaint  made  by  the  aggrieved 
person,  take  such  vehicle  to  the  nearest 
police  station  and  give  information  to  the 
police.  Failure  to  do  so  should  lead  to 
cancellation of the permit to ply. 
 
(5)   State  Governments  and  Union  Territories 
are directed to establish Women' Helpline in 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            24

teasing within three months. 
 
(6)   Suitable  boards  cautioning  such  act  of  eve-
teasing  be  exhibited  in  all  public  places 
including 
educational 
institutions,  bus  stands,  railway  stations, 
cinema  theatres,  parks,  beaches,  public 
service vehicles, places of worship etc.

(7)   Responsibility is also on the passers-by and 
on  noticing  such  incident;  they  should  also 
report the same to the nearest police station 
or  to  Women  Helpline  to  save  the  victims 
from such crimes. 
 
(8)   The 
State  Governments 
and  Union 
Territories of India would take adequate and 
effective  measures  by 
issuing  suitable 
instructions  to  the  concerned  authorities 
including  the  District  Collectors  and  the 
District  Superintendent  of  Police  so  as  to 
take  effective  and  proper  measures  to  curb 
such incidents of eve-teasing.”

is  a 
Determination by the Court 
24.  
Now  coming  to  the  merits  of  the  instant 
petition. The careful scanning of the record, it reveals 
that  the  Petitioner  alleges  in  paragraph  5  of  the 
petition  that  some  staff  members/colleagues  were 
feeling jealousy from the fame of the Petitioner in the 
University and they planted a plan in league with the 
Respondent  No.7 
to 
defame/trap 
him 
and 
consequently  filed  concocted  complaint  against  him. 
It  is  a  matter  of  common  sense  and  even  a  man  of 
prudent  mind  cannot  think  that  just  to  defame  a 
person/colleague  student,  a 
lady  can  ruin  her 
modesty/dignity/respect  herself  by  making  false 
complaint  of  sexual  harassment.  The  Act  has  been 
promulgated  for  the  safety  of  persons  who  feel 
unsecure at the workplace and to teach a lesson to the 
transgressors for their act of sexual harassment, abuse 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            26 
or  assault.  Such  like  acts  should  be  condemned  and 
discouraged, especially in the educational institutions.  
Furthermore,  admittedly  the  Petitioner  was  awarded 
major  penalty  after  an  inquiry  into  the  matter  by  the 
competent  authority.  By  taking  a  lenient  view  the 
Respondent  No.5  has  already  modified  his  major 
punishment 
from  “dismissal 
from  service” 
to 
“removal  from  service”.  The  learned  counsel  for  the 
Petitioner has failed to point out any illegality or legal 
perversity  in  the  impugned  orders  14.04.2017  (order 
of  dismissal  form  service)  &  03.12.2018  (order  of 
Ombudsperson  altering  punishment  of  the  petitioner 
form  „dismissal‟  to  „removal‟)  which  otherwise  have 
been passed aptly. 
Moot Point-II 
Whether  the  Respondents  were  justified  to  expel 
the  Petitioner  from  Ph.D.  programme  of  the 
University? 
25.  
The  Petitioner  also  challenged  the  order 
dated  19.04.2017,  whereby  he  was  expelled  from 
University  of  Lahore  as  a  student  of  Doctor  of 
Philosophy 
in  Bio  Technology.  Earlier, 
the 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            27 
petitioner‟s  matter, in  this  regard, was  referred  to  the 
Higher  Education  Commission,  vide  order  dated 
14.06.2017  passed  by  this  Court  in  Writ  Petition 
No.31900/2017 with the direction to the Commission 
to  treat  the  matter  as  representation  by  the  petitioner 
and  to  decide  the  same  within  seven  days.  The 
Commission/respondent 
No.3 
submitted 
its 
compliance  report  on  30.08.2018.  The  relevant  paras 
of  the  report  and  decision  of  HEC/respondent  No.3 
are reproduced hereunder for ready reference: - 
“The Registrar further explained that as per 
inquiry,  after  examination  of  record  it 
revealed  that  accused  Asif  Saleem  has 
exhibited  morally  degraded  behavior  and 
has betrayed the confidence of the students. 
A  perusal  of  Whatsapp  chat  shows  that 
conversation  replete  with  double  entendr 
(expression  that  can  be  understood  in  two 
different  ways  with  one  way  usually 
referring it to sex). The chat clearly exposes 
depraved  moral  character  of  the  accused. 
The  petitioner  sounds  more  like  a  sexual 
maniac  or  to  say  the  least  a  mentally  ill 
person.  He  further  stated  that  Asif  Saleem 
Ex-Assistant  Professor  IMBB  has  indulged 
himself in act of moral turpitude and is unfit 
to  be  faculty  member  and  student  of  this 
University. Keeping in view, the welfare and 
well-being  of  students  of  the  University,  he 
was not only dismissed as a faculty member, 
but  also  expelled  from  the  University  as  a 
Ph.D  student  and  he  was  barred  from 
entering  any  campus  of  University  of 
Lahore…

Decision: 
has 
recommended 
The  HEC  above  Committee  after  hectic 
deliberation 
the 
University  of  Lahore  decision  particularly 
with  w.r.t discontinuation of prosecution of 
his Ph.D studies as well as policy guidelines 
prepared  by  the  HEC  regarding  the  sexual 
harassment in institutions of higher learning 
and  the relevant  class  as  reproduced  above 
does  not  allow  a  student  to  continue  his 
studies in the same institution where he has 
been found guilty of sexual harassment.”   
26.  
 
In 
the  wake 
of 
afore-mentioned 
circumstances  as  well  as  detailed  inquiry  report  & 
decision of HEC, the petitioner has been found guilty 
of  committing sexual  harassment  at the  workplace.  It 
would  not  be  out  of  place  to  mention  here  that  the 
persistent  and  unwanted  amorous  advanced  by  the 
petitioner  to  a  female  student  would  amount  to  a 
fundamental  breach  of  the  implied  term  of  mutual 
trust  and  confidence.  No  doubt,  more  and  more  girl 
students,  women  etc.  go  to  educational  institutions, 
work  places  etc.,  their  protection  is  of  extreme 
importance 
to  a  civilised  and  cultured  society. 
Moreover,  The  International  Labour  Organization 
Declaration  of  Philadelphia  (1944),  states  that  “all 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            29 
human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have 
the right to pursue both their material well-being and 
their  spiritual  development  in  conditions  of  freedom 
and  dignity,  of  economic  security  and  equal 
opportunity.”  As  earlier  discussed,  it  is  also  our 
constitutional  duty  to  protect  women  to  ensure  their 
full participation  in all spheres  of national  life, under 
Article 25 read with 34 of the Constitution.   
27.  
Thus, I am of the view that  if the Petitioner 
is  allowed  to  continue  his  Ph.D.  program  in  the  said 
University,  he  will  remain  a  constant  threat  to  the 
victim/Respondent  No.7  as  well  as  other  female 
students.  Therefore,  in  order  to  create  a  safe  and 
healthy  educational  environment  for  all  the  female 
students,  the  presence  of  the  petitioner  in  the  said 
University  is  unwarranted  and  unjustified.  Moreover, 
the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  failed  to  point 
out  any  infirmity,  perversity  and  illegality  in  the 
inquiry conducted by the University  as well as in the 
decision of the HEC.

Whether this petition can be dismissed in limine?

VII. 
DOCTRINE OF LIMINE CONTROL 
28.  
It is a general practice of Courts that in such 
like  petitions,  the  Courts,  instead  of  dismissing  the 
petition  at 
limine  stage, 
issue  notices 
to 
the 
respondents who not only face inconvenience but also 
suffer  monetary  loss.  Thus,  for  early  and  expeditious 
disposal of such like petitions and other cases pending 
in  the  Courts  all  over  the  country  and  in  order  to 
strengthen  the  perception  of  general  public  about  the 
rule  of  law;  there  is  urgent  need  to  adopt  “Limine 
Control  Doctrine.”  According  to  Cassell’s  Latin 
Dictionary,  the  word  “Limine”  comes  from  the  latin 
noun  “Limen”,  meaning  “the  threshold”.  Hence,  the 
phrase  “In  Limine”  means  “at  the  threshold”.  In 
Black‟s  Law  Dictionary  (5th  ed.  1979)  the  phrase  is 
defined  as  “on  or  at  the  threshold;  at  the  very 
beginning; preliminary”. In The Bank Of Nova Scotia 
V.  Edward  M.  Del  Grande  the  court  of  appeal  for 
ontariogrange  j.A.    (in  chambers)  defined  motion in 
limine as:- 
“In  limine is  not  an  expression  in  common 
current use.  It means simply preliminary.”

issues 
limine is 
“In limine motions are designed to facilitate 
the  management  of  a  case,  generally  by 
deciding  difficult  evidentiary 
in 
advance  of trial.  The  usual  purpose  of 
to  preclude 
motions in 
the 
presentation 
of evidence deemed 
inadmissible  and  prejudicial  by  the  moving 
party. A typical order in limine excludes the 
challenged evidence and  directs  counsel, 
parties,  and witnesses not  to  refer  to  the 
excluded  matters 
The 
advantage  of  such  motions  is  to  avoid  the 
obviously futile attempt to unring the bell in 
the event a motion to strike is granted in the 
proceedings before the jury...” 
during trial.

In  Hawthorne  Partners,  an 
Illinois 
General  Partnership  Vs.  AT  &  T  Technologies, 
Inc.,  a  New  York  Corporation,  and  ENSR 
Corporation,  a  Delaware  Corporation  reported  at 
831 F.Supp. 1398 (1993) defined Motions In Limine 
as: 
“This  court  has  the  power  to  exclude 
evidence in  limine only  when  evidence  is 
clearly 
inadmissible  on  all  potential 
grounds.  Federal  district  courts  have 
authority to make in limine rulings pursuant 
to  their  authority  to  manage  trials.  Unless 
evidence  meets 
standard, 
evidentiary  rulings  should  be  deferred  until

resolved  in  proper  context.    Denial  of  a 
motion in  limine does  not  necessarily  mean 
that all evidence contemplated by the motion 
will  be  admitted  at  trial.  Denial  merely 
means  that  without  the  context  of  trial,  the 
court  is  unable  to  determine  whether  the 
evidence in question should be excluded.”  
 
31.  
     In  Muhammad  Mustafa’s  case  (PLD 
1992  SC  62),  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  observed 
as: 
for 
enquiry 
“At  a  limine  hearing  the  High  Court  is  not 
only  competent  but  also  bound  to  make 
preliminary 
reaching  a 
preliminary  satisfaction  about  the  factual 
basis of a writ petition. Ignoring this part in 
the  writ  petitions  sometimes 
to 
unnecessary  admission  of  writ  petitions 
which  ultimately,  after  considerable  time 
and expense, are dismissed.” 
 
leads 
 
32.            In  Malik  Gul  Hassan‟s  case  (1995  CLC 
1662), the Hon‟ble Court observed as: 
“Generally  when  the  High  Court  does  not 
find  it  appropriate  to  admit  for  regular 
hearing  a  petition  and  before  issuing  a 
notice to the respondent-party, dismisses the 
petition  after  summary  hearing  it  is  said  to 
be dismissed in limine.”  
 
In  National  Judicial  Policy  2009  it  is 
33.  
candidly stated as under: 
“Writ  petitions  under  Article  199  of  the 
Constitution  should  be  fixed  for  'Katchi 
Peshi'  on  the  next  day  of  institution  and  be 
disposed of as quickly as possible.”

The  concept  of  limine  control  is  not  a  new 
one; in number of constitutional petitions filed under 
Article 199 of the Constitution, the Hon‟ble Superior 
Courts  dismissed  the  petitions  in  limine.  Following 
are certain instances:- 
i.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 
judgments  reported  at  2016  SCMR  842, 
2011  SCMR  1813  and  PLD  2010  SC  969 
has  held  that  in  the  wake  of  availability  of 
an alternate efficacious remedy, jurisdiction 
of  this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the 
Constitution  cannot  be 
invoked.  The 
constitutional  petition  was  dismissed  in 
limine. (2017 P L C (C.S.) 304); 
 
Inordinate  delay  in  invoking  Constitutional 
jurisdiction of High Court. Writ petition was

In  appellate  domain  the  Honorable  Superior 
Courts have also applied doctrine of „Limine control‟ 
W.P. No.28791 of 2019   
 
            36 
and have dismissed appeals in limine. Following are 
certain instances:- 
i. 
Regular  First  Appeal  could  be  dismissed  in 
limine without summoning the record. (2008 
SCMR 635); 
 
ii.  Order XLI, rule 11 of the Civil Procedure 
Code, 1908 empowers the Appellate Court 
to  dismiss  the  appeal  without  sending 
notice to the lower Court for transmission 
of  record  and  without  notice 
the 
respondent. ( 2 0 0 6   S C M R   8 9 5 ) ;  
to 
iii.  Where facts narrated in impugned judgment 
were  not  disputed  and  appeal  could  be 
decided  on  basis  of  available  record,  then 
summoning  of  record  from  Trial  Court 
would not be necessary.(PLD 2004 SC 10); 
iv.  Court  may  dismiss  appeal  in  limine  where 
the same on the face of it is barred by time, 
barred by any law and disputed questions of 
law and facts are not involved. (2003 SCMR 
1790); 
v. 
It is not an inflexible rule of practice that the 
first  appeal 
from  an  order  should  be 
invariably admitted which in no case can be 
dismissed  in  limine.  Depending  upon  the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case  and 
the statute under which an appeal is filed it 
is  difficult  to  lay  down  an  absolute  rule  of 
practice for all cases.(PLD 2002 SC 720); 
vi. 
Time barred appeal was dismissed in limine 
on  ground  of  limitation.  The  order  was 
upheld by Honorable Supreme Court. (2001 
SCMR 2016); 
vii.  Court  can  dismiss  appeal  in  limine  where 
case is of a simple nature and no question of 
law  or  fact  is  involved  for  determination. 
(1998 S C M R 1970)

Similarly,  it  is  advisable  that  due  to  huge 
pendency  of  false,  frivolous  and  malicious  claims 
and to curtail undue harassment of defendants and to 
generate public confidence in the judicial system, the 
trial Courts/lower appellate Courts should judiciously 
and  equitably  apply  doctrine  of  limine  control 
through  effective  use  of  provisions  of  Civil 
Procedure  Code,  1908  i.e.  Oder  7  Rule  11,  Order  7 
Rule 10, Order 15 Rule 1 to 4, Order 41 Rule 11 and 
Section  56  of  Specific  Relief  Act,  1877.  Under  the 
wisdom  that  the  court  could  always,  nip  a  frivolous 
suit in the bud, in order to retain its docket and time 
for  more  serious  claims.  Such  exercise  of  discretion 
is  grounded  on  good  public  policy  and  case 
management plan.  
 
VIII.  CONCLUSION 
37. 
In view of the above facts and circumstance 
and  by  applying  the  doctrine  of  „Limine  Control‟ 
this  petition,  being  devoid  of  merits,  is  dismissed  in 
limine.
