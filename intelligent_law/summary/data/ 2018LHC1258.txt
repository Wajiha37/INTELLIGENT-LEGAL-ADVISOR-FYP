C.M.NO.02 OF 2017 
This  application  in  terms  of  Section  5  of  The 
Limitation  Act,  1908  seeks  condonation  of  delay  in  filing  the 
appeal, which is barred by 31 days.  
2.  
Learned  Law  Officer  submits  that  delay  in  filing  of 
appeal  is  the  result  of  non-availability  of  certified  copies  of 
necessary  documents  as  well  as  delayed  sanction  to  file  the 
Intra Court appeal. He added that law favours the adjudication 
on  merits  and  the  government  could  not  be  penalized  on 
account  of  act  of  delinquent  officials.  In  support  of  his 
contentions,  learned  Law  Officer  has  placed  reliance  on 
“GOVERNMENT  OF  KHYBER  PAKHTUNKHWA  through 
Secretary  Industries  Commerce  and  Mineral  Development, 
Peshawar 
and 
others 
v.  FRONTIER  CHEMICALS 
INDUSTRIES RAM BAGH, MARDAN” (2016 SCMR 1410).

3.  
We  have  heard  learned  Law  Officer  at  some  length 
and perused the record. 
4.  
The  respondent/  writ  petitioner  filed  a  writ  petition 
averring  therein  that  he  applied  for  the  post  of  Tubewell 
Operator  in  Agronomic  Research  Centre,  Khanewal  and  after 
completion  of  the  process,  he  was  declared  as  successful 
candidate as per merit list dated 19th September, 2017 securing 
highest  marks  but  due  to  imposition  of  ban  on  recruitments 
after 31st December, 2007, no appointment letter was issued in 
his favour. The writ petition was allowed by the learned Single 
Judge  in  Chamber  vide  judgment  dated  11th  September, 2017, 
which is impugned herein.  
5.  
It is an admitted fact that the writ petition was allowed 
vide  judgment  dated  11th  September,  2017  directing  the 
appellants  to  issue  appointment  letter  in  favour  of  respondent 
No.1  within  30  days  on  the  basis  of  recommendations  dated 
19th  September,  2007  prepared  by  the  departmental  selection 
committee.  
6.  
In  view  of  stance  taken  by  the  learned  Law  Officer, 
we  have  gone  through  the  record,  which  reflects  that  copy  of 
the  judgment  was  applied  on  24th  October,  2017,  which  was 
delivered  on  25th  October,  2017  whereas  the  Intra  Court 
Appeal  was  filed  on  3rd  November,  2017.  Article  151  of  The 
Limitation  Act,  1908  provides  20  days  for  filing  an  appeal 
from  a  decree  or  order  of  a  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its 
original  jurisdiction.  As  already  observed  that  judgment  was 
passed  on  11th  September,  2017  whereas  application  for 
obtaining  certified  copies  was  moved  on  24th  October,  2017 
after 43 days of the passing of the judgment. Period of 20 days 
prescribed under Article 151 of The Limitation Act, 1908  was 
clearly  elapsed  on  1st  October,  2017  and  the  copies  were  thus 
applied after lapse of 23 days of the limitation period.  
                 I.C.A No.390 of 2017

7.   
Law is well settled that limitation of 20 days provided 
under Article 151 of The Limitation Act, 1908 for filing appeal 
mentioned therein would start running from the date of decree 
or  order  passed  by  the  High  Court  in  its  original  jurisdiction. 
There  is  no  ambiguity  or  disparity  in  Article  151  of  The 
Limitation  Act,  1908  for  reckoning  the  said  period.  Thus,  the 
time  spent  in  obtaining  certified  copies  of  the  relevant  record 
would  not  be  excludable  from  the  period  prescribed  for  filing 
the  Intra  Court  Appeal.  In 
the  case  of  “KHAWAJA 
MUHAMMAD  AFZAL  and  another  v.  SH.  MUHAMMAD 
SADIQ and others” (1998 SCMR 179), the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan,  while  dilating  upon  the  issue  in  hand,  held 
as under: - 
“It  is  well  established  that  once  time  has  begun  to 
run  it  does  not  stop.  The  time  for  filing  the  Letters  Patent 
Appeal  having  already  expired  neither  the  time  spent  in 
pursuing  the  review  application  nor  the  time  spent  in 
obtaining  copy  of  the  order  passed  by  the  Single  Judge 
could be deducted from the period of 20 days. Similarly the 
time  spent  in  obtaining  copy  of  the  order  rejecting  the 
review application could not be deducted as under the Rule 
it was not necessary to file copy of that order alongwith the 
memorandum  of  the  Letters  Patent  Appeal.  In  computing 
the time for filing the Letters Patent Appeal the High Court 
had thus fallen in error.” 
The  above  view  was  adopted  by  this  Court  in  the  case  of 
“ASHIQ  HUSSAIN 
SABRI 
v. 
SECRETARY  HEALTH, 
GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB” (PLD 2011 Lah. 490) 
8.   
In  the  case  of  “MINISTRY  OF  DEFENCE  and  3 
others    v.  MUHAMMAD  ATHAR”  (2013  MLD  1284)  while 
dealing with scope and the impact of Article 151 and Sections 
12, 14 of The Limitation Act, 1908, it was held as under: - 
6. 
“The  limitation  provided  for  filing  an  appeal  from  a 
decree  or  order  of  a  High  Court  in  the  exercise  of  its  original 
jurisdiction  is  twenty  days  from  the  date  of  decree  or  order  as 
provided under Article 151 of the First Schedule provided under 
section  3  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908.  Column  No.3  of  the  said 
Schedule  is  meant  for  mentioning  of  time  from  which  period 
begins  to  run  and  against  Serial  No.151  in  Column  No.3,  the 
                 I.C.A No.390 of 2017

starting period is given as “the date of the decree or order” and 
the  present  filing  of  appeal  is  not  given  any  relaxation  for 
exclusion of the period spent in obtaining the certified copies of 
the relevant record.” 
The  judgment  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge  was 
7. 
delivered  on  6-5-2011.  On  behalf  of  the  appellants,  an 
application for  obtaining  certified  copies  of  the  relevant  record 
was made on 12-5-2011 and the record was prepared in shape of 
certified  version  on  17-5-2011.  CPLA  was  filed  on  9-7-2011, 
which was the 58th day of passage of the judgment by the learned 
Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.7537 of 2009. 
8. 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  when  disposed 
of  the  said  CPLA,  made  certain  observations,  which  are  of 
significance  for  the  purposes  of  disposal  of  the  present  Civil 
Miscellaneous  seeking  condonation  of  delay  in  filing  of  Intra-
Court  Appeal.  The  order  was  passed  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  of  Pakistan  on  24-9-2012  in  presence  of  both the  parties 
and it is clearly noted that it was never disputed before the apex 
Court that the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge was 
amenable to Intra-Court Appeal. It is also noteworthy that when 
the CPLA was ordered to be converted into ICA, it was ordered 
to  be  sent  back  to  the  High  Court  for  “decision  in  accordance 
with law subject to all just and valid objections”. 
The CPLA was allowed to be converted into ICA and at 
9. 
the  cost  of  repetition  the  date  of  filing  CPLA  is  once  again 
provided viz. 9-7-2011. When the CPLA was converted into ICA 
and  the  same  is  being  heard  by  us  as  ICA,  the  date  of  filing 
CPLA must be taken as a date of filing of ICA. As noted earlier, 
the date of filing of CPLA was the 58th day from the date, when 
the learned Single Judge passed the judgment in Chambers on 6-
5-2011. 
10. 
Although  there  is  no  concept  of  exclusion  of  the  time 
spent  in  obtaining  the  certified  copies  of  the  relevant  record  in 
case an ICA is to be filed, nevertheless after exclusion of the said 
period  of  six  days  (from  12-5-2011,  the  date  of  submission  of 
form  in  Copying  Agency  for  obtaining  certified  copies  of 
relevant  record  to  17-5-2011;  when  the  copies  were  prepared), 
even  then,  it  would  become  52nd  day,  when  the  ICA  was 
considered  to  have  been  filed.  Keeping  in  view  the  period  of 
limitation provided under Article 151 of the Limitation Act, 1908 
the ICA was thus barred by 132 days on the date of its filing. 
11. 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  while 
converting the CPLA into ICA and by remitted the same back to 
the  Court,  left  it  open  for  this  Court  to  decide  the  appeal  in 
accordance  with  law  subject  to  all  just  and  valid  objections, 
thus, we can examine the objection raised by the respondent with 
regard to the limitation. 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case of “Mst. 
Khadija Begum and 2 others v. Mst. Yasmeen and 4 others (PLD 
2001  Supreme  Court  355)  while  dealing  with  the  question  of 
limitation  has  categorically  held  that  sufficient  cause  must  be 
                 I.C.A No.390 of 2017

shown by the person seeking condonation of delay, which means 
“circumstances  beyond  control  of  party  concerned”  and  that, 
nothing  shall  be  deemed  to  be  done  in  good  faith  which  is  not 
done with due care and attention. 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  of 
13. 
Federation  of  Pakistan  and  2  others  v.  Khurshid  Ahmed  and 
another    (1999  SCMR  664)  has  dealt  with  the  question  of 
availability of ICA or otherwise and interesting factor is that in 
the  reported  matter,  the  General  Headquarters  (GHQ)  was  a 
party to the litigation and after such authoritative findings by the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  the  General  Headquarters 
must become wiser and aware of the remedy available under the 
law but notwithstanding such position a remedy by way of CPLA 
was  availed,  while  ICA  was  undeniably  available  to  the 
aggrieved party. It is a settled position of law that in case of time 
barred  proceedings,  defaulting  party  must  explain  the  delay  of 
each day caused in preferring a valid proceedings in accordance 
with law.” 
9.  
  
A  party,  while  seeking  condonation  on  account  of 
limitation,  has  to  explain  delay  of  each  and  every  day  as  the 
question of limitation is as important as the jurisdiction of the 
Court. In terms of Section 3 of The Limitation Act, 1908, it  is 
the bounden duty of every Court to take notice of the question 
of  limitation,  even  if  not  raised  in  defence  by  the  contesting 
party.  Reliance  in  this  respect,  if  need,  can  be  placed  on 
“UNITED  BANK  LIMITED  and  others  v.  NOOR-UN-NISA 
and others” (2015 SCMR 380). 
10. 
While  adverting  to  the  contention  of  learned  Law 
Officer  that  lenient  view  shall  be  taken  while  pressing  the 
hurdle  of  limitation  in  the  way  of  government,  it  is  observed 
that  each  and  every  case  has  its  own  facts.  The  Courts  are 
obliged to decide the lis on the basis of available material and 
keeping  in  view  the  conduct  of  the  parties  in  the  said  matter. 
No  cavil  that  in  case  of  “GOVERNMENT  OF  KHYBER 
PAKHTUNKHWA through Secretary Industries Commerce and 
Mineral  Development,  Peshawar  and  others  v.  FRONTIER 
CHEMICALS  INDUSTRIES  RAM  BAGH,  MARDAN”  (2016 
SCMR 1410), the Hon’ble Apex Court condoned the delay of 
41  days  in  filing  the  petition  by  the  Government  of  Khyber 
                 I.C.A No.390 of 2017

Pakhtunkhwa  but  while  going  through  the  facts  of  the  said 
case,  we  are 
in  agreement 
that 
the  same  are  clearly 
distinguishable to the facts in hand. In the present case, though 
a plea has been taken that delay in filing of appeal is the result 
of  non-availability  of  certified  copies  of  necessary  documents 
as well as delayed sanction to file the Intra Court appeal but no 
cogent  material  is  available  to  this  effect  and  only  a  general 
and  bald  assertion  is  made,  which  is  not  sufficient  for 
extending  the  discretion  in  each  and  every  case  where  the 
government is confronted with the question of limitation. 
11. 
 
While  examining  the  question  of  limitation  on 
the  above  prospective,  we  have  noted  that  the  only  reason 
assigned  in  the  application  is  that  time  was  consumed  due  to 
non-supply of the necessary certified copies as well as delayed 
sanction from the concerned quarters. The reason so pleaded is 
apparently fallacious and without substance as the copies were 
even  applied  after  the  expiry  of  limitation  prescribed  under 
Article  151  of  The  Limitation  Act,  1908.  Mere  bald  and 
general  assertions  are  not  sufficient  justifying  condonation  of 
delay on the part of government or its functionaries. 
12. 
There  can  be  no  distinction  between  an  ordinary 
litigant  and  the  government  institutions  in  the  matter  of 
limitation.  Every 
statute 
is  meant 
to  eliminate 
the 
discrimination  and  government  institutions  cannot  be  given 
preferential status  before  a  Court  of  law.  We  are  cognizant of 
the  fact  that  principles  of  natural  justice  are  founded  on  the 
equality of the citizens, which is even guaranteed under Article 
25 of The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
The  State  or  Government  cannot  be  treated  differently  unless 
such  privilege  is  extended  through  a  lawful  statute.  Reference 
in  this  respect  can  be  made  to  “FEDERATION  OF  PAKISTAN 
through  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Government  of 
Pakistan,  Islamabad  and  5  others  v.  JAMALUDDIN  and  others” 
                 I.C.A No.390 of 2017

(1996  SCMR  727),  “FEDERATION  OF  PAKISTAN  through 
Secretary,  Ministry  of  Finance  v.  NIAZ  AHMAD”  (1997  PLC 
(C.S.)  750)  and  “PAKISTAN  RAILWAY  ADVISOR  AND 
CONSULTANCY 
SERVICES 
(PRACS)  RAILWAY  BURT 
INSTITUTE v. Ch. MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN” (2003 CLC 81). 
13. 
The  nutshell  of  above  discussion  is  that  instant 
application  is  without  any  substance.  Resultantly  the  same  is 
dismissed.
