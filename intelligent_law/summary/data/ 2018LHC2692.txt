2. 
Through  the  above-captioned  constitution  petitions,  the 
petitioners  have  assailed  the  legality  and  validity  of  the  orders 
passed by the Returning Officer, whereby he refused to receive 
the  party  lists  of  their  candidates  in  order  of  priority  for  seats 
reserved  for  women  and  non-Muslims  on  account  of  one  day 
delay  in  submission  of  same  from  the  time  stipulated  in  the 
election  schedule.  Attempt  to  persuade  the  learned  Appellate 
Tribunal  by  filing  election  appeal  was  made,  which  also 
remained unsuccessful.  
3. 
Section  104  of  the  Elections  Act,  2017  mandates  that 
party  lists  of  candidates  in  order  of  priority  for  seats  reserved 
for women and non-Muslims shall be submitted with Returning 
Officer  within  the  time  specified  for  filing  the  nomination 
papers.  The  purpose  of  attaching  this  list  issued  by  the  party 
with  the  nomination  papers  is  to  confirm  that  he/she  is  a 
candidate  of  any  political  party  for  such  seats.  It  is  also  clear 
from  bare  reading  of  said  section  that  it  is  meant  for  the 
candidates  belonging  to  any  political  party.  Subsection  (4)  of 
Section 104 further postulates that if, at any time, the party list 
is  exhausted,  the  political  party  may  submit  a  name  for  any 
vacancy  which  may  occur  on  account  of  any  reason.  In  other 
words,  without  obtaining  this  list  the  Election  Commission  is 
not in a position to nominate any candidate claims to be related 
to  any  political  party.  It  is  also  discernible  from  aforesaid 
provisions  of  law  that  the  reserved  seats  have  been  allocated 
proportionately  according  to  the  seats  obtained  in  general 
election  by  the  political  parties  and  those  seats  which  come  in 
the  entitlement  of  any  party,  are  not  transferable,  therefore, 
mere delay of one day cannot be considered a sufficient ground 
to  deprive  the  present  petitioners  to  include  their  names  in  the 
list  of  eligible  candidates.  Even  otherwise  there  are  no  penal 
consequences  of  non-submission  of  the  party  lists  for  reserved 
Writ Petition No.222728/2018 
 
4 
seats;  hence,  this  deficiency  alone,  which  occurred  on  account 
of  late  issuance  of  party  lists  by  a  party  due  to  unavoidable 
circumstances,  does  not  cause  any  prejudice  to  any  other 
candidate and on the other hand non-acceptance of the lists may 
affect  the  election  notwithstanding  it  will  not  be  beneficial  to 
any other party. In this backdrop, by condoning one day delay, 
we  are  inclined  to  accept  all  these  writ  petitions  and  set-aside 
the  orders  impugned  passed  by  the  Returning  Officer  and  the 
learned  Appellate  Tribunal  concluding  that  the  party  lists  for 
reserved  seats  shall  be  accepted  and  candidates  shall  be 
accordingly  declared  and  included  in  the  list  of  eligible 
candidates.
