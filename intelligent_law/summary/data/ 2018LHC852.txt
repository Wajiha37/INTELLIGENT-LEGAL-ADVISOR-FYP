Admittedly  Board  of  Revenue  received  Reference 
from District Collector, Mianwali that present petitioners 
and  some  others  had  been allotted  State  land  against  the 
entitlement  certificates  issued  to  them  on  the  basis  of 
forgery  committed  with  the  khasragirdawari  entries  and 
on  probe  those  were  cancelled,  but  in  appeals  preferred 
by the affectees/petitioners as well as others, the orders of 
District  Collector  were  set  aside  and  certificates  of 
entitlement  were  revived  while  declaring  them  eligible 
for  the  alternate  land  of  15-Acres  each,  as  such  through 
the  Reference,  District  Collector  requested  for  the 
cancellation  of  allotments  being  their  disqualifications, 
which came up before Mr. Raza Ali, Member (Colonies), 
who  vide  order  dated  12.01.1995  was  persuaded  to 
conclude  that  allegations  leveled  against  the  affectees 
with regard to forgery were just and virtuous and District 
Collector  was  perfect  to  declare  them  ineligible  and 
Crl. Org. No.1300-W of 2013

disqualified,  but  when  leniency  was  pleaded  by  the 
forgers,  they  were  allowed  to  purchase  land on payment 
of  market  price  as  on  10.03.1993  plus  10%  surcharge 
payable  through  installments.  A  similar  order  dated 
25.05.1995  was  also  passed  by  the  same  Member  while 
exercising  his  suo  moto  powers, but  his  orders  were  not 
implemented  compelling  the  petitioners  to  approach  this 
Court  through  Writ  Petition  No.2261/2009  with  the 
following prayer:- 
It 
is, 
therefore,  most  respectfully 
prayed  that  inaction  of  respondent  not 
considering the case of the petitioners in the 
light  of  order  dated  12.1.1995,  12.04.1995 
and  25.5.1995  and  also  not  giving  the 
benefit  of  the  judgment  dated  5.9.2002, 
passed  by 
in 
W.P.No.18631  of  1998  may  very  kindly  be 
declared  as 
illegal,  ultra  vires  and 
respondents  be  directed  to  finalize  case  of 
the  petitioners  and 
them 
proprietary rights in accordance with law.  
this  Honouable  Court 
to  grant 
 
 
which  came  up  for  hearing  before  his  lordship  Maulvi 
Anwarul  Haq,  as  he  then  was,  who  vide  order  dated 
06.02.2009  disposed 
it  of  with 
the 
following 
conclusion:- 
Writ petition accordingly is disposed 
of  with  direction  to  respondent  No.2  to 
take  up  the  application  (Annex.G)  and  to 
decide  the  same  in  the  light  of  said  order 
of  learned  Member,  Board  of  Revenue 
dated  25.5.1995  and  to  pass  appropriate 
orders  thereon,  preferably  within  eight 
weeks  of  the  receipt  of  copy  of  this  order 
along  with  copy  of  this  writ  petition  to  be 
remitted  to  the  said  respondents  by  the 
office immediately.

Pursuant 
thereto, 
the  District  Officer  (Revenue), 
Khushab  on  01.01.2010 
requested 
the  Secretary 
(Revenue),  Board  of  Revenue,  Punjab,  Lahore  for  the 
relaxation  of  restrictions  imposed  by  BoR,  Punjab, 
Lahore vide Circular dated 27.08.2003 for allotment of 
subject  land,  but  no  further  action  was  initiated, 
whereupon  petitioners  approached  this  Court  through 
the Criminal Original in hand for initiation of contempt 
proceedings  against  respondent  with  the  following 
prayer:-  
It  is,  therefore,  most  respectfully  prayed 
that  the  instant  petition  may  kindly  be 
accepted  and  contempt  proceedings  may 
kindly be initiated against the respondents 
and  they  may  graciously  be  punished 
exemplary,  in  the  save  administration  of 
justice. 
Any  other  relief  which  this  Honourable 
Court deems fit and appropriate may also 
be granted. 
2. 
During 
the  pendency  of 
this  Petition,  on 
06.05.2016,  this  Court  issued  direction  that  matter  be 
placed before learned Member (Colonies), BoR, Punjab, 
Lahore  to  comply  with the  directions dated  06.02.2009 
passed  in  W.P.No.2261/2009  through  a  speaking  order 
in  this  regard  and  petitioners  were  directed  to  appear 
before  him  on  16.05.2016  for  further  proceedings. 
Pursuant thereto, ultimately learned Member (Colonies) 
declined  their  request  vide  order  dated  18.08.2016,  but 
instead  of  assailing  the  vires  of  that  order  by  means  of 
independent  remedy,  they  are  interested  that  Khalid 
 
Crl. Org. No.1300-W of 2013

Iqbal, ADC (G) Khushab, the sole respondent should be 
punished  for  not  making  a  favourable  order  in  their 
favour. 
3. 
4. 
Heard and record perused. 
There is no denial of the fact that petitioners were 
ineligible and disqualified for the allotment of land, but 
on  account  of  leniency  and  willingness  pleaded  on 
behalf of the forgers, they were allowed to purchase the 
disputed  property  on  market  price  by  the  learned 
Member, Board of Revenue vie order dated 12.01.1995. 
It  was  not  the  discretion  of  the  latter  to  distribute  the 
valuable  State  property  to  such  like  persons,  who  had 
maneuvered the certificates through cheating and fraud, 
rather they as well as the Revenue Officials involved in 
such  like  illegal  activities  were  liable  to  be  prosecuted 
on criminal as well as departmental side. The argument 
of  Mr.  Arshad  Malik  Awan,  Advocate  for 
the 
petitioners  that  orders  of  the  learned  Member  had 
already  been  endorsed  by  this  Court  vide  order  dated 
06.02.2009 while directing the respondent to implement 
it  was  not  persuasive  for  the  counts;  firstly  the  order 
dated  06.02.2009  was  passed  without  giving  any  right 
of  audience  to  the  respondents  of  that  Writ  Petition; 
secondly the orders of the Member might have not been 
assisted in its true picture before my honourable brother 
and  lastly  I  am  not  persuaded  by  any  stretch  of 
imagination  that  leniency  could  be  extended  to  the 
Crl. Org. No.1300-W of 2013 
 
5 
felonious.  Each  and  every  authority  is  obliged  to  act 
under the law and law only and especially while dealing 
with the State property and public exchequer. 
5.  Mr. Malik failed to highlight any of the act of the 
respondent  to  be  penalized,  moreover  the  petitioners 
approached  this  Court  through    Constitutional  Petition 
No.2261  of  2009  whereby  respondents  thereof  were 
directed to take up the application of the petitioners and 
decide  it  in  the  light  of  aforenoted  order  of  learned 
Member  through  appropriate  orders  and  subsequent  to 
filing  of  Criminal  Original  in  hand  vide  order  dated 
06.05.2016  the  matter  was  again  placed  before  learned 
Member for compliance of order dated 06.02.2009, who 
explicitly  declined  the  request  of  the  petitioners  on 
some grounds and once findings  were handed down by 
him  there  was  nothing  more  available  for  this  Court  to 
probe  any  further.  The  direction  of  this  Court  issued 
vide  order  dated  06.02.2009  for  passing  an  appropriate 
order stood complied with by the learned Member  vide 
his  order  dated  18.08.2016,  so  I  do  not  find  anything 
left with this Court for being implemented, however, the 
legality  or  otherwise  of  the  said  order  may  be  assailed 
through  independent  remedy.  As  by  way  of  passing 
order  dated  18.08.2016 
the 
learned  Member  has 
complied  with  the  direction  passed  by  this  Court  in 
W.P.No.2261/2009,  neither 
any  proceedings 
in 
contempt  could  have  been 
initiated  against 
the 
Crl. Org. No.1300-W of 2013 
 
6 
respondent  nor  this  Court  gave  another  direction  for 
implementation  of  said  order,  which  to  me  was  unjust, 
without  jurisdiction  and  against  law,  hence  instant 
Criminal Original is dismissed accordingly.
